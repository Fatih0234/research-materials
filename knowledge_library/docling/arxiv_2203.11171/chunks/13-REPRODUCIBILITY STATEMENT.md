## REPRODUCIBILITY STATEMENT

In experiments, we included four different language models with varying scales. Two of them are public models: UL2 is a completely open-sourced model with model checkpoints available at https:// github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/ul2 ; GPT-3 is also a public model with public API available at https://openai.com/api/ . For GPT-3, we have included two public engines ('code-davinci-001' and 'code-davinci-002') to further aid reproducibility, as Codex is currently free so anyone can reproduce the results. In addition, as our results make use of LaMDA-137B and PaLM-540B that are not publicly available, we provide the exact input prompts for all tasks in Appendix A.3 (and note that we do not perform any finetuning and only apply prompting to off-the-shelf language models).
