## ETHICS STATEMENT

As we stated in the discussion, language models can sometimes generate nonsensical or non-factual reasoning paths, so one should use language models' outputs with extra caution. We deal with reasoning tasks mostly and the generated rationales are only used for inspecting how a model reaches its answer. One could potentially use the generated rationales to further check why the model makes certain mistakes or whether the model contains any biases when performing a certain task. For language model in real-world use, further work is needed to better ground models' predictions and improve model's factuality and safety, to ensure the models do not cause harms to users.
