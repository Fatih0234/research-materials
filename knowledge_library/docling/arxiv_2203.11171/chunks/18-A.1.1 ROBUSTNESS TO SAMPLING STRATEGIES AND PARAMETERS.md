## A.1.1 ROBUSTNESS TO SAMPLING STRATEGIES AND PARAMETERS

In Figure 6 we ablate the results with respect to different sampling strategies and parameters by varying T in temperature sampling and k in Topk sampling, on LaMDA-137B. We show that self-consistency is robust to various sampling strategies and parameters.

In Figure 7 and Figure 8, we show the results of self-consistency compared with greedy decoding a single path over LaMDA-137B and PaLM-540B, respectively. Self-consistency improves over greedy decode by a quite significant margin on both models, on top of high accuracy already achieved by scaling up model sizes.

Figure 7: Self-consistency (blue) significantly improves accuracy across various arithmetic and commonsense reasoning tasks, over LaMDA-137B. Sampling a higher number of diverse reasoning paths consistently improves reasoning accuracy.

We further show additional sampled reasoning paths from the LaMDA-137B model in Table 12, and sampled reasoning paths from the PaLM-540B model in Table 13. We see that the diversity in the additionally sampled reasoning paths indeed helps the model arrive at a more correct final answer after aggregation.
