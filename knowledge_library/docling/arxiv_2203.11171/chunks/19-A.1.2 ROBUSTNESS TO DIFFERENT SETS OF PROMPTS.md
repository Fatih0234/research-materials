## A.1.2 ROBUSTNESS TO DIFFERENT SETS OF PROMPTS

In Table 9, we further show that self-consistency is quite robust to different sets of input prompts. We manually wrote 3 different sets of chain-of-thought as prompts to the model. Across all sets of prompts, self-consistency yields consistent gains over the original CoT approach.
