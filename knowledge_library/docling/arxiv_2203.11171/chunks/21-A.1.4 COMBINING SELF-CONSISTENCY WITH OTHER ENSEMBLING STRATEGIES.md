## A.1.4 COMBINING SELF-CONSISTENCY WITH OTHER ENSEMBLING STRATEGIES

Self-consistency is completely compatible with other ensemble strategies, although the gains achieved by self-consistency are significantly higher than other ensemble strategies (and can 'override' the performance gains achieved by other ensemble strategies). We further performed experiments and include the results in Table 11 (for a fair comparison, we use 40 sets of prompts, or 40 prompt permutations to compare with self-consistency with 40 paths, all experiments are based on PaLM540B).

|                                                    |   GSM8K accuracy |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Different sets of prompts (x40)                    |             58.9 |
| Prompt-permutation (x40)                           |             59.6 |
| Self-consistency (x40)                             |             74.4 |
| Self-consistency + different sets of prompts (x40) |             75.4 |
| Self-consistency + prompt-permutation (x40)        |             73.8 |
