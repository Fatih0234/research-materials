## 2.2 Are these just simulations?

One objection to AI-based experiments is that these are simulations or agent-based models (ABMs), which have had a somewhat limited impact on economics. While they have their place, economists generally take a dim view of simulation-based approaches. However, there is an enormous difference compared to experimentation with AI agents. With ABMs, the researcher is both judge and jury: you program the agents and then see what they do. Rather than 'What would homo economicus do?' it is 'What would [this model that does what I tell it to do] do?' and people are less interested in that. This is arguably why Schelling (1971) is the exception that proves the rule: because the decision rule was so simple and obvious, readers knew there was no card up his sleeve, no trick to ensure the surprising emergent phenomena. In contrast to ABMs, homo silicus is not under our direct control as researchers. However, we can-as I will show-influence their behavior with endowments of beliefs, political commitments, experiences, and so on. But we are still constrained by the

underlying model which determines behavior, not our direct programming.
