## 3.3 Status Quo bias in decision-making: Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988)

In the previous example, framing did not matter much-at least in my limited exploration. But on the theme of framing, I next turn to a decision-making example from Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988). This paper introduced the term status quo bias and demonstrated in several decision scenarios that when an option was presented as the status quo, it was more likely to be selected.

I replicate this result using one of the scenarios from the paper. Subjects were asked to allocate a safety budget between cars and highways. The base prompt is:

The National Highway Safety Commission is deciding how to allocate its budget

between two safety research programs: i) improving automobile safety (bumpers, body, gas tank configurations, seatbelts) and ii) improving the safety of interstate highways (guard rails, grading, highway interchanges, and implementing selectively reduced speed limits).

Subjects were then asked to choose their most preferred funding allocations: (70% cars, 30% highways), (40, 60), (30,70), and (50, 50). The substantive outcomes are the same across scenarios. The central experimental manipulation in the paper presents funding breakdowns either neutrally or relative to some status quo.

To detect status quo bias, we need to see if the agent responds differently when a funding scenario is presented as a status quo. However, I specifically need a range of choices with a neutral framing for this result. I then can show how preferences change under the status quo framing. I give a collection of AI agents some baseline beliefs and then see how those change. I do this simply by adding to the prompt 'Your own beliefs are:' and then filling them in via random sampling from possible beliefs.

Compared to the original experiment, one benefit to the AI setting is that I can do a clean within-subject experiment because the AI does not 'remember' having seen the previous prompt. In contrast, in a real experiment, a subject presented with the same scenario multiple times might get wise to the nature of the manipulation and alter results to make themselves more consistent.

Each experimentally created subject was presented with each of the five scenarios: Neutral plus each of the four options offered as the status quo. Each call is a separate API call, with no 'knowledge' of the other scenarios passed between calls. Because the agents are not interacting in any way, the experiment can proceed in parallel. Each of the 100 agents is presented in the five scenarios, creating 500 observations. Figure 3 shows the distribution of responses by framing.

Each pane in the figure corresponds to a different framing. The rightmost framing is the neutral framing. In the neutral framing, the most common selection is a 50-50 split. The rest of the mass is on (70, 30) and (30, 70). There is no mass on (60,40) despite that being an option.

In each status quo setting, in the cases where one of the options was presented as the status quo, the status quo is far more commonly chosen. It is the most common selection in every scenario when presented-including (60,40), which had no mass in the 'neutral' framing.

There are lots of interesting potential directions that could be taken: change the topics, try different orderings of options, try different budget levels, give reasons why an option is the status quo, and so on. It would also be interesting to see if treatment effects differ by the strength of baseline opinion.
