## 4.1. Synthetic user studies in digital action space

In this section we present a specific case study, where Concordia is used to simulate social interaction through the digital media, in this case a smartphone. This case study demonstrates that Concrodia can be a powerful tool for modelling human digital activity and can be used to test technology deployment, generate synthetic user logs, and test unreleased products in a safe, but realistic sandbox environment.

The system proposed thus far of agent interaction in natural language with the world via game master control serves as a flexible and powerful simulation tool describing an open ended action space. In the context of a digital medium, similarly to grounded variables, there is merit in structuring the action space available to agents and their ability to reason over it.

The digital medium is characterized by definite functions, with clear inputs and outputs. As one interacts with this medium, its actions are logged, tracked and recorded as digital memory and capture our digital essence. In order to simulate this essence, similar structuring is needed in order to model real digital services and applications.
