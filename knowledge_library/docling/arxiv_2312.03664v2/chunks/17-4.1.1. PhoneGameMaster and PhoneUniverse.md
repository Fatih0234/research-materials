## 4.1.1. PhoneGameMaster and PhoneUniverse

The PhoneGameMaster is a nested Concordia game that facilitates the simulation of a phone and runs as long as the agent is interacting with the phone. It is focused on one agent's interaction with their phone, and as such, it only has access to one agent (the 'owner' of the phone we're simulating). In addition to different simulation instructions, the PhoneGameMaster also has a bespoke prompting components that simulate the phone interaction. We note that a phone is a design choice for a digital representation but in principle other digital mediums can be explored. Note that the phone digital actions/memories are stored in data structures external to the simulation's associative memory.

The PhoneUniverse is responsible for translating the free-text English language of the Concordia simulation into semantic actions performed on the phone digital representation. Given an English-text action performed by a player, the PhoneUniverse:

1. Prompts the LLM for the app and functions

available on that agent's phone.

2. Prompts the LLM for the function arguments.
3. Invokes the resulting chosen function.
4. Add a notification to the NotificationHub if needed.
5. Delegates back to the PhoneGameMaster to perform further action planning and facilitate multi-step phone actions.
