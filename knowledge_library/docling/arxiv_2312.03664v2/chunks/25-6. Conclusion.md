## 6. Conclusion

The approach to generative agent-based modeling we described here provides researchers and other users with tools to specify detailed models of phenomena that interest them or of technologies and policies they seek to evaluate. Of course, like all research methodologies it should be expected to come with its own strengths and weaknesses. We hope to discover more about

when this style of modeling can be fruitfully applied in the future. While there are no panaceas for modeling, we think there are good reasons to look to GABM (and Concordia in particular) when constructing models of social phenomena, especially when they involve communication, social construction of meaning, and common sense, or demand flexibility in defining grounded physical, social, or digital environments for agents to interact in.
