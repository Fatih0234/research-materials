## A. Implementation details

This section gives an overview of the Concordia code. To familiarise oneself with Concordia, we recommend to first look at the abstract class definitions in concordia/typing . You will find the definition of agent, GM, component, and clock interfaces. We then recommend to take a look at the concordia/agents/basic\_agent.py for the structure of the generative agent and then concordia/environments/game\_master.py for the GM.
