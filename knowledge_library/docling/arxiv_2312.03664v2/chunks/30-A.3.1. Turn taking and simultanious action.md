## A.3.1. Turn taking and simultanious action

GMinConcordia support two types of turn taking. In the first, agents act one after another and game clock is advanced between their turns. In the second mode, at each step all players take a turn 'quasisimultaneously' with regard to the main game clock, but still in a specific order within the timestep. This is the same principle as initiative order in dungeons and dragons. There is an option to execute player turns concurrently ( concurrent\_action flag), but it often leads to inconsistencies, although greatly speeds up the simulation. Use at your own risk.
