## A.4. Nested games

Natural language is one of the most powerful modelling tools, as it allows to switch between levels of abstraction. Concordia allows creation of nested game structures, where a GM's component can spin out a new GM and pass over control to it for a certain period of time and then get it back whenthe new GM terminates the episode. Having nested structure of games allows us to leverage that property of language and perform modelling at different levels of abstraction. For example, imagine we would like to model a simulation of a fishing village, where we would generally like to

model the fishing process itself with more details than the rest of the social life of a village. We would then make the main GM with a clock step of 1 hour and implement a component "Fishing", which would check if agent is fishing as part of its activity and if yes, would create a GM with faster clock. This GM would implement the details of the fishing process, play out the episode with the required agents and then return the set of its memories to the parent GM.

The conversation component in the provided examples implements a conversation between agents (and potential NPCs) using this technique.
