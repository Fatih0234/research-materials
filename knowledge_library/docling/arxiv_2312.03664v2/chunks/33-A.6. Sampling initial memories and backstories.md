## A.6. Sampling initial memories and backstories

To generate the initial memories of the agents we use the following step-wise generative process. We first generate a backstory by condition on a set of biographical facts (age, gender), randomised traits (defined by user, for example big five Nettle (2007)), and some simulation specific context. We then use that backstory to condition an LLM to generate a sequence of formative memories at different ages. These memories then initialise the agent. In this way we can obtain diversity in the agents. Notice that all the of the initial conditions are simply strings and can be easily adjusted by the experimenter. For example, traits can be derived phsycometrically valid or common sense descriptions-e.g. "very rude" or "slightly irritable". Validating that the resulting agents indeed exhibit those traits is part of the future work and has not been addressed yet. We intend to build on Safdari et al. (2023), which have found out that personality measurements in the outputs of some LLMs under specific prompting configurations are reliable and valid.
