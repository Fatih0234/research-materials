## A.7.1. Creating Phone Apps

In Concordia, phone apps are implemented by subclassing the PhoneApp class and decorating callable actions with @ app\_action . Concordia is then able to automatically generate natural English descriptions of the app and its supported actions using the class and methods' docstring and annotated types. PhoneApps are free to run any Python code and connect to external services. For example, an implementation of a toy calendar app might look like this:

c l a s s CalendarApp(PhoneApp):

```
def name(): return "My Calendar " def description (): return " This i s a calendar app" @app_method def add_meeting( participant : s t r ) : " " " Adds a meeting " " " s e l f . _meeting . append ( . . . )
```
