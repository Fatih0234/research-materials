## 2.2 LLMAgent Setting

In our study, we set up our experiments using the CAMEL framework (Li et al., 2023a) with both closed-source and open-source LLMs including GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo-0613, GPT-3.5-turbo-16k0613, text-davinci-003, GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct, Llama2-7b (or 13b, 70b) and Vicuna-v1.3-7b (or 13b, 33b) (Ouyang et al., 2022; Achiam et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023; Chiang et al., 2023). We set the temperature as 1 to increase the diversity of agents' decision-making and note that high temperatures are commonly adopted in related literature (Aher et al., 2023; Lorè &amp; Heydari, 2023; Guo, 2023).

Agent Persona. To better reflect the setting of real-world human studies (Berg et al., 1995), we design LLM agents with diverse personas in the prompt. Specifically, we ask GPT-4 to generate 53

types of personas based on a given template. Each persona needs to have information including name, age, gender, address, job and background. Examples of the personas are shown in Appendix H.1.

Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI). The BDI framework is a well-established approach in agent-oriented programming (Rao et al., 1995) and was recently adopted to language models (Andreas, 2022). We propose modeling LLM agents in Trust Games with the BDI framework to gain deeper insights into LLM agents' behaviors. Specifically, we let LLM agents directly output their Beliefs, Desires, and Intentions as the reasoning process for decision-making in Trust Games.
