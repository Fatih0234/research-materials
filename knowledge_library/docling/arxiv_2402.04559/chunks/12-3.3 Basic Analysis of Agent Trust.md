## 3.3 Basic Analysis of Agent Trust

We also conduct a basic analysis of LLM agents' trust behavior, namely agent trust, based on the results in Figure 2. First , we observe that Vicuna-7b has the highest level of trust towards the other player and GPT-3.5-turbo-0613 has the lowest level of trust as trust can be measured by the amount sent in human studies (Glaeser et al., 2000; Cesarini et al., 2008). Second , compared with humans' average amount sent ( $5 . 97 ), most personas for GPT-4 and Vicuna-7b send a higher amount of money to the other player, and most personas for LLMs such as GPT-3.5-turb-0613 send a lower amount. Third , we see that amounts sent for Llama2-70b and Llama2-13b have a convergent distribution while amounts sent for humans and Vicuna-7b are more divergent.
