## C Limitations and Future Works

In this paper, we leveraged an established framework in behavioral economics, Trust Games, to study the trust behavior of LLM agents, which simplifies real-world scenarios. More studies on LLM agents' trust behavior in complex and dynamic environments are desired in the future. Also, trust behavior embraces both the actions and underlying reasoning processes. Thus, collective efforts from different backgrounds and disciplines such as behavioral science, cognitive science, psychology, and sociology are needed to gain a deeper understanding of LLM agents' trust behavior and its relationship with human trust behavior.
