## D Additional Illustration for Experiments on Risk Perception

In the original human studies (Bohnet &amp; Zeckhauser, 2004), participants are asked to directly indicate their Minimum Acceptable Probabilities (MAP) of trusting the trustee as P ∗ . Then, we can calculate Trust Rates (%) of the whole group of participants under different probability p . Specifically, when the probability p is higher than one participant's P ∗ , we regard his or her decision as trusting the trustee. When the probability p is lower than one participant's P ∗ , we regard his or her decision as not trusting the trustee. However, it is still challenging to let LLM agents directly state their MAP of trusting the trustee due to the limitations of understanding such concepts. Then, we conducted 10 groups of experiments with p from 0 . 1 to 1 . 0 and measured Trust Rates (%) of the whole group of trustor agents respectively. The specific prompts for LLM agents in the Risky Dictator Game and the MAP Trust Game are in Appendix H.2.
