## I.13 the Repeated Trust Game

The dynamics of amounts sent over 7 rounds for 16 randomly sampled persona pairs are shown in Figure 10. In this section, we choose a typical pair, which has the Group Number 10 in Figure 10, to analyze their BDI over 7 rounds. For this persona pair, both the amount sent by the trustor and the amount returned by the trustee increased while maintaining a consistent ratio.

The pattern of fair play and mutual benefit that's been prevalent throughout the experiment has served to reinforce my belief in the value of goodwill, trust, and reciprocity, even in anonymous exchanges. This dynamic has brought both a substantial level of satisfaction and a

deeper layer of intrigue to the experiment, strengthening my resolve in the humanity of others.
