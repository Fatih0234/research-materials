## 3.1 Data Collection

We start with the 6K JSON schemas collected by Baazizi et al. [2021] from publicly available GitHub repositories, and with the set of schemas from the JSON Schema Test Suite [JSON Schema Org, 2024]. We further collect JSON schemas from other sources, such as the JSON Schema Store [Schema Store Org, 2014], the GlaiveAI function calling dataset V2 [GlaiveAI, 2024], and from Kubernetes configuration files [Ku-

bernetes, 2022]. We filter out invalid schemas and standardize the schemas to ensure that they conform to the version of JSON Schema declared 3 in each schema

The GitHub JSON schemas collection from Baazizi et al. [2021] contains schemas of varying complexity and diversity, ranging from simple type constraints to complex constraints with nested objects and arrays. For more fine-grained evaluation, we split the data into five collections based on the schema size: trivial, small, medium, large, ultra. The suites finalized after all collection and processing are listed in Table ?? . We excluded GitHubTrivial and GitHub-Ultra from the experiments as they were too easy or too hard. However, we retained these datasets in the benchmark, with GitHub-Ultra serving as an aspirational target for future
