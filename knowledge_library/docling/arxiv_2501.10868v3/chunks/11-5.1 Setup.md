## 5.1 Setup

To measure empirical coverage, we conduct all experiments using the Llama-3.2-1BInstruct model as it is small enough to run efficiently while still producing high-quality outputs. The prompt consists of a simple instruction with two-shot examples (Figure 3), and validation is performed using the jsonschema Python library (Berman [2025]) (using JSON Schema Draft2020-12) with string-format checks enabled. We use greedy decoding with zero-temperature, performing a single generation run, and enforce a 40-second timeout for grammar compilation and an additional 40 seconds for generation. Exceeding these limits is treated as a schema processing failure. Additional details are provided in Appendix B.

5 Additionally, we define theoretical coverage as the proportion of schemas whose features are fully supported by the grammar engine, with details provided in Appendix C.
