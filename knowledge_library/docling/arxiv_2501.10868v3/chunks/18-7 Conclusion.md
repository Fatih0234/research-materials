## 7 Conclusion

We have proposed a comprehensive evaluation framework for constrained decoding frameworks with JSON schemas, focusing on efficiency, coverage, and output quality. We introduced JSONSchemaBench, a benchmark comprising 10K real-world JSON schemas, to enable robust assessment under realistic conditions. Our evaluation highlights both the advancements and limitations of current state-of-the-art constrained decoding frameworks. We hope that our findings and benchmark will inform future research in structured generation and provide valuable insights to help the community identify the most effective tools and to extend capabilities with constrained decoding.
