## 2. Cleaning

- Deduplicate: Removed duplicate schemas to eliminate redundancy and maintain a diverse dataset. Key ordering within schemas was ignored when determining duplicates.
- Empty Schema: Excluded schemas that were lacking meaningful constraints, effectively 'empty.'
- Unresolved References: Removed schemas containing unresolved $ref references to external URLs.
- Schema Version Fixes: Corrected mismatched or missing draft versions.
- Extraneous Field Removal: Eliminated unrelated fields such as command , config , path , and controls .
- Regex Escaping: Fixed escaping issues in regular expressions to ensure validity.
