## A.3 Feature Distribution

We count the appearance of each feature (keyword) in the 10K schemas and show the most frequent features in Figure 2a. We separately plot usage of the format keyword, which is used to specify format of string such as date-time , email , uri . This is worth highlighted because each of these formats can be quite complex to implement on its own The distribution of formats used is shown in Figure 2b.
