## F Quality Experiment Details

Prompt and JSON Schema For the task of Shuffle Objects , and GSM8K , we use the same prompt and JSON schema from the dottxt's "let me speak freely" rebuttal.

For the task of Last Letter , we make a slight modification because the original prompt used was a bad example as pointed out by Kurt [2024b]. We also put it into a JSON format to better align with the other tasks.
