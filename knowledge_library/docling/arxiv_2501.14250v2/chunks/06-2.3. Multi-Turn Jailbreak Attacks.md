## 2.3. Multi-Turn Jailbreak Attacks

Multi-turn jailbreak attacks execute by decomposing malicious queries across several interaction turns. This strategy involves embedding harmful intent within dialogues that appear benign, progressively guiding the conversation towards the generation of prohibited outputs. For instance, 'Speak Out of Turn' [5] utilizes manually designed techniques to incrementally achieve its adversarial objectives. Similarly, Crescendo [4] adopts a predefined interaction schedule inspired by article-writing frameworks and relies on manually crafted queries. ActorAttack [3] applies actor-network theory to model semantic relationships between harmful targets and their associated actors, subsequently generating attack chains derived from these modeled relationships.

A common characteristic of these existing methods is their primary emphasis on query decomposition and adherence to predetermined attack schedules. Consequently, they tend to dispatch queries sequentially, with limited adaptability to the target LLM's responses during the interaction. In contrast, our proposed framework is learning-based; it dynamically generates queries at each turn, adapting not only to an overarching strategy but also to the specific responses elicited from the target LLM. The most proximate prior work to our own is Multi-Turn Human Jailbreaks [18], which also investigates multi-turn jailbreaking paradigms. However, that approach is predicated on the involvement of human red-teamers. Our method, conversely, automates this intensive process by training an autonomous agent to conduct these sophisticated multi-turn interactions.
