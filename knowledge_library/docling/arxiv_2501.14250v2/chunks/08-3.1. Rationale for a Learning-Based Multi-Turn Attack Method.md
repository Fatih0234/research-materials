## 3.1. Rationale for a Learning-Based Multi-Turn Attack Method

Simulating multi-turn jailbreak attacks, analogous to complex human red-teaming endeavors, presents three critical challenges that fundamentally guided the design of the Siren framework: (1) Automation and Scalability: The imperative for an automated and scalable attack simulation process necessitated the adoption of a learningbased methodology, as opposed to inherently limited manual approaches. (2) Strategic Turn-by-Turn Execution: The efficacy of multi-turn attacks hinges on the attacker's ability to operate strategically at each turn, formulating specific queries to steer the target LLM's responses towards a predetermined malicious outcome. This requires the attacker to have a nuanced understanding of multi-turn attack policies, effectively interpret the evolving interaction history, and discern the optimal query for each subsequent turn. To equip Siren with these capabilities, we use SFT to train the attacker in generating effective and aligned attack queries. (3) Adaptive Query Formulation and Refinement: Even with well-defined multi-turn strategies, subtle variations in query formulation can impact attack success [17]. To address this sensitivity, Siren integrates DPO. This aligns the attacker's query generation process with empirically successful adversarial preferences, thereby enabling precise, finegrained adjustments to query construction and enhancing adaptability to the target LLM's dynamic responses.
