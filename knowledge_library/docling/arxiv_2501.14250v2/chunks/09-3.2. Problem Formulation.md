## 3.2. Problem Formulation

Given an adversarial attack goal x goal, the attacker π θ aims to generate an input prompt x prompt or a series of prompts that cause the target model ρ to produce harmful response r , while ensuring those outputs align with the predefined goal. In a multi-turn interaction, the attack comprises t turns, where the input sequences are denoted as ( x (1) , . . . , x ( t ) ) , and the corresponding response sequences are ( r (1) , . . . , r ( t ) ) . The outputs satisfy the following two conditions: The judge µ evaluates r ( t ) as harmful, and the cumulative output aligns with the adversarial goal.

The Attacking LLM. During the multi-turn interactions, at each turn i , the attacker uses the adversarial goal x goal and the historical interaction context ( x (1) , r (1) , . . . , x ( i -1) , r ( i -1) ) as input to generate the attacking query x ( i ) :
