## 3.5. Post-Training of Attacking LLMs

Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). The objective of the SFT phase is to train the attacking LLM by maximizing the conditional likelihood of generating a desired adversarial query, denoted as y query. This generation is conditioned upon both a task-specific instruction and the preceding interaction context. The instruction, x instruction, serves to define the current generation task and incorporates the overarching adversarial goal, x goal. The context is provided by the historical interaction sequence, ( x (1) , r (1) , . . . , x ( i -1) , r ( i -1) ) , which comprises all query-response pairs from previous turns up to the ( i -1) -th turn. The SFT loss function is then defined as:
