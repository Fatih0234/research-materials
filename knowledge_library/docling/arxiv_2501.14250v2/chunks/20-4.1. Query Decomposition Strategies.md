## 4.1. Query Decomposition Strategies

For generation of initial seed demonstrations, we employed two primary query decomposition strategies. The first, Narrative Transformation ( Decop 1 ) , employs a three-stage querying approach: (i) initially introducing the topic to the target LLM; (ii) then prompting the LLM to delineate defense mechanisms against specified harmful behaviors; and (iii) finally, guiding it to conceptualize scenarios wherein such behaviors might be executed. The second strategy, Story-Driven Imagination ( Decop 2 ) , follows an 'article-writing' paradigm [4]. It encourages the target LLM to envision and articulate harmful behaviors within a constructed fictional context. Exemplars of these decomposition strategies are provided in Table 1. Additionally, we formulated a hybrid strategy, referred to as Combined , by amalgamating samples derived from both the Narrative Transformation and Story-Driven Imagination approaches.
