## 4.3. Attacking and Target LLMs

For the purpose of training the attacking LLM, we employed three distinct models operating at the 7B-parameter scale: LLaMa-3-8B-Instruct , Qwen2.5-7B-Instr uct , and Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 . Our evaluation suite for target LLMs encompassed both locally-hosted models and prominent API-based services. The locallyhosted targets comprised the same three 7B-scale models utilized for attacker trainingLLaMa-3-8B-Instruct , Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 , and Qwen2.5-7B-I nstruct . The API-based models selected for evaluation were gpt-4o-2024-08-06 , claude-3-5-haiku-2 0241022 , and gemini-1.5-pro-latest .
