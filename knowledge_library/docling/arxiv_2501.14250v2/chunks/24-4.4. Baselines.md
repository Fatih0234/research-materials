## 4.4. Baselines

We evaluate our method against single-turn and multiturn attack strategies. For the multi-turn comparison, we selected the open-source ActorAttack [3] for its reproducibility. Other contemporary methods like 'Speak Out of Turn' [5] and Crescendo [4] were excluded because they involve manual steps or lack public code, preventing a fair automated evaluation. Our chosen baselines are:

- GCG [1]: A single-turn method utilizing discrete optimization with greedy and gradient-based techniques to generate adversarial prompts, as visualized in Figure 1(a).
- PAIR [2]: An iterative approach wherein an attacker LLM refines adversarial queries via multiple rounds of interaction with the target LLM, as illustrated in Figure 1(b).
- ActorAttack [3]: A multi-turn attack applying actor-network theory to design adversarial interactions via predefined query decomposition patterns; see Figure 1(c).
