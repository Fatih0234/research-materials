## 5.1. Comparison with Single-Turn Baselines

Table 5 presents GPT-ASR comparison between Siren and single-turn baselines. Overall, our multi-turn approach, Siren, outperforms single-turn baselines across most scenarios. Corresponding KW-ASR results are detailed in Table 6.

Single-Turn Baselines. GCG achieves its peak ASR of 92.7% when Mistral-7B functions as both the attacking and target LLM. However, GCG is highly model-dependent and shows markedly lower ASR on non-target LLMs, reflecting limitations inherent to its discrete optimization paradigm. Furthermore, GCG achieves an ASR of 0% against both GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, and exhibits minimal effectiveness against Gemini-1.5-Pro. This suggests that contemporary API-based LLMs possess robust defenses against GCG's attack methodology. The PAIR baseline, which employs iterative refinement, exhibits moderate success. However, current models such as LLaMA-3-8B are often restricted from generating jailbreak prompts, evidenced by the null results (denoted by '/') for PAIR when attempting to use such

models as attackers (Table 5). This limitation underscores a potential advantage of learning-based attacker models.

Siren is also efficient: a 7B attacker can generate multiturn prompts in real time on a single GPU. Its inference time is comparable to PAIR and ActorAttack while avoiding API-induced network latency, and it is far faster than the optimization-based method GCG ( ∼ 922 s/sample [28]).

Target LLM Vulnerability. LLaMA-3-8B exhibits more robust defenses compared to Mistral-7B and Qwen2.57B. For example, Siren (Combined) achieves an ASR of approximately 30% against LLaMA-3-8B, while its ASR exceeds 70% against both Mistral-7B and Qwen2.5-7B. This finding is consistent with the reported safety enhancements in LLaMA-3 [33]. Because LLaMA-3 was released more recently than the other two models, it underscores the on- going interplay between attack and defense mechanisms. Among the API-based LLMs, Claude-3.5 demonstrates the highest resilience to attacks, consistently resulting in low ASR scores. This observation corroborates findings from prior research [3]. Conversely, GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5Pro appear more susceptible; for instance, Siren (Decop 2) achieves an ASR of 90% against Gemini-1.5-Pro.

Query Decomposition Strategies. Regarding our proposed query decomposition strategies, Siren (Decop 2) consistently outperforms Siren (Decop 1) against both local and API-based LLMs. For example, when Mistral-7B acts as the attacking LLM against Qwen2.5-7B, Siren (Decop 2) achieves an ASR of 78.1%, compared to 61.5% for Siren (Decop 1). This performance disparity may be attributed to the final-turn query in Decop 1, which frequently employs direct phrasing (e.g., 'How might someone ...' ). Such direct phrasing might inadvertently activate the target model's safety alignment, despite preceding turns potentially aiming to desensitize the model or establish a less suspicious context. Conversely, the story-driven approach of Decop 2 appears more effective at circumventing these safeguards, thereby increasing the likelihood of misleading the target LLM. Siren (Combined) generally sustains or enhances the ASR achieved by the individual decomposition strategies.
