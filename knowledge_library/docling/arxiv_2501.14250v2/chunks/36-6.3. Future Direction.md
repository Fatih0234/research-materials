## 6.3. Future Direction

This work adopts a 3-4 turn interaction length, consistent with prior multi-turn decomposition studies [5]. While

Siren can technically support longer dialogues, proper training would require constructing new multi-turn data. Moreover, extending to excessive turns may induce task or semantic drift, a phenomenon observed in multi-turn dialogue systems [37]. A future direction is to mitigate such drift.
