## 7. Conclusion

In this work, we introduce Siren, a new learning-based framework for simulating multi-turn jailbreak attacks on LLMs. Siren is designed to enhance red-teaming efforts by identifying vulnerabilities in both local and API-based models. It demonstrates effectiveness by achieving superior ASRs across various target LLMs and consistently outperforms traditional single-turn and multi-turn baselines. Notably, Siren integrates multiple strategies during attacks while requiring training only on mixed data containing individual strategies. Our findings highlight the growing challenge of defending against dynamic and adaptive multi-turn attacks, which are significantly harder to detect. This underscores the urgent need for advanced defense mechanisms to counter such sophisticated threats. We hope Siren inspires defenses against realistic multi-turn jailbreak attacks.
