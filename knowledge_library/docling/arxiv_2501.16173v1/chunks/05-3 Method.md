## 3 Method

We investigate whether LLM agents are more successful when prompted to behave aggressively, cooperatively or neutrally, which we term their attitude . The LLMs are prompted to write a strategy in natural language, which is then converted into a Python algorithm. These generated strategies are manually checked for safety before their performance is assessed in all-play-all IPD tournaments. Additionally, we examine which equilibria systems converge to when selection pressure favours higher-performing strategies.
