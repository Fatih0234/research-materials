## 3.1 Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Tournament

In a tournament, each participant plays against all others: all n ( n -1) 2 possible pairs compete in a match. Each match consists of 1000 rounds of Prisoner's Dilemma (Table 1), a wellstudied mixed-motive game where players can achieve high scores through mutual cooperation or by unilaterally defecting against a cooperating opponent. In any given round, defect (D) is the dominant action, as the player will receive a higher payoff regardless of their opponents' choice of action. Mutual defection, however, provides a low payoff, so players want to incentivise their opponent to cooperate (C).

Some matches use noise, in which case there is, independently for each player, a 10% chance that their action choice is replaced with the alternative action. Our implementation uses the Axelrod Python library [Knight et al. , 2016].
