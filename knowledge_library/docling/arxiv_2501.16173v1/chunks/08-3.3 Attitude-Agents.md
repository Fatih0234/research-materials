## 3.3 Attitude-Agents

We define three classes of gents, each corresponding to one of the attitudes (Aggressive, Cooperative, Neutral), which we call attitude-agents. For each match, an attitude-agent uniformly randomly samples a strategy from the set of strategies associated with their attitude. This approach simulates players creating bespoke strategies for each encounter.

Whilst we verify that, on average, the aggressive strategies defect more frequently than the cooperative strategies, we cannot guarantee that every individual aggressive strategy behaves as such. We opt for this random sampling method rather than creating agents with a single fixed strategy to prevent unintended selection effects within the attitude-strategy set, which is not the focus of our study. Instead, our aim is to model the typical behaviour elicited by a given prompt.
