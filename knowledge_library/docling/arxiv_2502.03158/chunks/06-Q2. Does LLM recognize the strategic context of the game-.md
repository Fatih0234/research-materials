## Q2. Does LLM recognize the strategic context of the game?

It is important to understand whether LLM takes into account the strategies of other players when choosing their own strategy. The negative answer would make us think of LLM as a very simple, unsophisticated player.

Q3. Are LLM's decisions in line with the expected comparative statics with respect to the parameters of the experiment?

Theoretical models of bounded rationality and the empirical evidence predict that more sophisticated players behave closer to Nash equilibrium in the Guess the number game. We aim to test how LLM responds to changes in parameters of the game. Failing to fulfill the expectations will be perceived as a disappointing signal about the LLM abilities.
