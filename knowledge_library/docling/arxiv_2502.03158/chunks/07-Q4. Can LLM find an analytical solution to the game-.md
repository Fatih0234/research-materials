## Q4. Can LLM find an analytical solution to the game?

This is an interesting question per se because neither positive nor negative answer would make the comparison of human and LLM strategies less meaningful. Recall that some of the previous experiments included those participants who are definitely unfamiliar with dominant strategies and Nash equilibrium concepts, whereas other experiments included game theorists who are presumably able to find the theoretical equilibrium in the Guess the number game. We evaluate whether an LLM can identify a weakly dominant strategy in a two-player game.
