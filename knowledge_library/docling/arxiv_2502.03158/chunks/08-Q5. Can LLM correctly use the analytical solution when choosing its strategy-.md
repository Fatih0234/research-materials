## Q5. Can LLM correctly use the analytical solution when choosing its strategy?

In case of a positive answer, for the game of 𝑛 = 2 players we would expect that LLM always plays a weakly dominant strategy. For the 𝑛 &gt; 2 case, we do not infer too strong conclusions because dealing with the real-world competitors requires the correct evaluation of their complexity rather than following the theoretical predictions.
