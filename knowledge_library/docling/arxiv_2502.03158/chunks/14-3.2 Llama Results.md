## 3.2 Llama Results

In addition, a supplementary analysis was conducted on Llama models of varying sizes with respect to their number of parameters. The results for the Llama family of models clearly demonstrate that the number of parameters strongly influences performance in the beauty contest game (Table 7). As shown in the table, smaller Llama models (e.g., 1B, 3B, 8B) tend to produce guesses that deviate substantially from the theoretical Nash equilibrium of zero, often generating values comparable to or even higher than human participants' choices. By contrast, larger versions of Llama (70B and especially 405B) yield results much closer to the equilibrium. This systematic pattern suggests that model size may serve as a reliable proxy for sophistication: the more parameters the model possesses, the closer its strategic reasoning approaches the theoretical benchmark. In other words, scaling up the Llama architecture appears to enhance its capacity for iterative reasoning, thereby making the model 'smarter' in the sense of converging more closely toward equilibrium behavior.
