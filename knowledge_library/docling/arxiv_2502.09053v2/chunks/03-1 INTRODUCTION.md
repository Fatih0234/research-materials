## 1 INTRODUCTION

Game theory provides a mathematical framework for analyzing strategic interactions among rational agents, and it has evolved significantly since its seminal work [1]. Over the decades, it has established robust methodological foundations, including equilibrium analysis [2], mechanism design [3], information design [4], and social choice theory [5]. These concepts serve as essential analytical tools across diverse disciplines such as economics, political science, and computer science, offering insights into decision-making in competitive and cooperative environments. More recently, this field has also contributed to artificial intelligence [6, 7], particularly in multi-agent systems and algorithmic game theory, as AI systems increasingly interact in complex ways.

The rapid advancement of large language models has revolutionized natural language processing and artificial intelligence [8-11]. With their remarkable capabilities in language comprehension, generation, and reasoning, LLMs are increasingly integrated into various applications and have opened new avenues for research. This growing attention on LLMs has led to a surge of studies at the intersection of game theory and LLMs. Specifically, various work investigates how game-theoretic principles can enhance LLM evaluation and development, as well as how LLMs can contribute to advancing game theory itself .

In this survey, we categorize these research efforts into four key directions:

- Evaluating LLMs in Game-based Playgrounds (Section 2): This area focuses on constructing game-based benchmark environments, such as foundational matrix games [12] and communication-based games like Avalon [13], bargaining [14], and auctions [15], to systematically evaluate the strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Researchers are also investigating how advanced techniques like prompt engineering [13, 16], training [17, 18], and tool-using [19, 20] influence LLM performance in these strategic contexts.
- Improving LLMs with Game-theoretic Methods (Section 3): This direction explores how concepts from cooperative and non-cooperative game theory, such as Shapley Value [21], social choice theory [22], and max-min equilibria [23], can be utilized to design more efficient and theoretically sound algorithms for LLMs. Gametheoretic methods offer potential solutions for key LLM challenges, including model interpretability, general preference alignment, heterogeneity, and dynamic adaptation.
- Characterizing LLM-related Events through Game Models (Section 4): As LLMs are emerging technologies profoundly impacting human society and production, researchers are constructing game models to characterize events related to their development and deployment. This includes studies modeling the competition among multiple stakeholders in LLM development [24, 25], as well as those focusing on the societal impact of LLMs through game-theoretic lenses [26, 27].
- Advancing Game Theory with LLMs (Section 5): Leveraging their superior natural language comprehension and generation capabilities, LLMs are being employed to advance classic game theory. Specifically, LLMs can be used to solve intractable games [28, 29] and generalize classic game models to more realistic settings [30, 31], offering new computational approaches to complex game-theoretic problems.

Existing surveys on the intersection of game theory and LLMs primarily examine how game theory can be used to build evaluation environments and assess LLMs' strategic performance [32-34]. For instance, Zhang et al. [32] classified studies based on the game scenarios used to test LLM capabilities and methods for improving their reasoning. Meanwhile, Feng et al. [33] and Hu et al. [34] categorized the core competencies required for LLM-based agents in games, such as perception, memory, role-playing, and reasoning. These surveys offer valuable insights into the burgeoning field of LLM evaluation within strategic contexts. However, they predominantly adopt a unidirectional perspective, Manuscript submitted to ACM

treating game theory as a tool for evaluating LLMs and improving LLMs' reasoning in games, overlooking the broader roles that game theory plays in developing LLMs and how LLMs are influencing game theory. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a novel four-part taxonomy presented visually in Figure 1, which offers a holistic understanding of the synergistic interplay between these two critical domains. To our knowledge, this taxonomy provides the first truly comprehensive and structured analysis of the bidirectional relationship for this dynamic and interdisciplinary landscape. Therefore, we believe this work offers a nuanced and expansive perspective, enriching both domains.
