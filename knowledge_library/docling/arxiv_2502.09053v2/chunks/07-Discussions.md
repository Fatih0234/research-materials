Many current findings on the behavioral characteristics of LLMs are closely tied to specific model architectures or versions, making them potentially obsolete as the technology rapidly evolves. It would be highly valuable to explore or derive more fundamental and generalizable strategic patterns of LLM behavior through game-theoretic scenarios that transcend individual models. While recent efforts to enhance LLMs' reasoning abilities have largely focused on task-specific approaches, developing a unified framework for improving general game-playing and reasoning capabilities remains a significant and open challenge.

The observed behavioral patterns, particularly the pro-social biases and strategic limitations, are not arbitrary phenomena. They are, in large part, artifacts of the very training and alignment techniques used to build these models. The tendency towards fairness and cooperation, for example, is a direct result of methods designed to make LLMs helpful and harmless. In the next section, we turn our attention to these underlying mechanisms, examining how game-theoretic principles are themselves being used to improve LLMs, which in turn shape the behaviors we have just reviewed.
