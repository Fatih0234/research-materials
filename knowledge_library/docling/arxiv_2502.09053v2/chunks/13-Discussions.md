## Discussions

Although theoretical guarantees ensure desired properties, implementing these methods in practice poses significant challenges for robust performance. For example, computing the exact Shapley value is often intractable, and approximations suffer from high variance. Similarly, training self-play methods for value alignment or static problem-solving frequently encounters instability. Additionally, extracting preferences from highly heterogeneous datasets introduces further hurdles, such as incentive misalignment and moral constraints. Thus, substantial research opportunities remain to improve robustness, stability, and efficiency, building on the foundational ideas presented in this section.

The game-theoretic methods used to enhance LLM interpretability, alignment, and adaptation do not exist in a vacuum. They are developed in response to the immense economic and social pressures that define the LLM ecosystem. The competition among stakeholders, the economics of data, and the deployment of LLMs as strategic actors in society create the demand for more robust, efficient, and aligned models. In Section 4, we will analyze this broader strategic
