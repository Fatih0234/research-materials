## 4 CHARACTERIZING LLM-RELATED EVENTS THROUGH GAME MODELS

As LLMs evolve from mere tools to active institutional players within markets, platforms, and information ecosystems, their behavior is no longer driven solely by technical objectives. Game theory provides a rigorous framework for analyzing the increasingly complex strategic interactions surrounding the development, deployment, and societal integration of LLMs. This section reviews recent advances in game-theoretic modeling applied to LLMs and categorizes them into two complementary streams: Subsection 4.1 addresses strategic games arising directly from the development and deployment lifecycle of LLMs, encompassing data acquisition, fine-tuning, platform economics, and content monetization. In contrast, Subsection 4.2 examines broader societal impacts of LLMs, including platform-creator dynamics, policy-induced externalities, and economic coordination challenges. The key problem settings, game notions, and summarized insights are presented in Table 3.
