Game-theoretic modeling provides a structured lens for analyzing strategic behaviors in the LLM ecosystem and understanding their broader societal implications. However, most existing results depend on simplified environments, typically involving a small number of rational agents with limited action spaces and clearly defined payoffs. These abstractions can overlook emergent behaviors from large-scale interactions and fail to account for bounded rationality, institutional dynamics, and ambiguous motivations. Bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and empirical observations remains a challenging yet promising direction for future research.

Thus far, we have explored how game theory is applied to evaluate, enhance, and characterize LLMs. As shown in our taxonomy, our survey considers a bi-directional relationship between the research on game theory and LLMs. In the next section, we will introduce studies that approach this intersection from a complementary perspective, discussing how they leverage LLMs' capabilities to advance classical game theory.
