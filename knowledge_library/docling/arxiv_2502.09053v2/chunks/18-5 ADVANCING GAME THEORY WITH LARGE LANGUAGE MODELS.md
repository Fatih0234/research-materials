## 5 ADVANCING GAME THEORY WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS

Traditional game theory strives for a comprehensive theoretical understanding within well-defined models. As a result, studies in this field often depend on formal, structured frameworks with limited strategy spaces and simplified communication protocols. While these constraints facilitate rigorous analysis and yield valuable theoretical insights, they also restrict the theory's ability to capture the complexities of real-world interactions. Large language models, with their rich linguistic, reasoning, and representational capabilities, introduce a new computational paradigm. By using natural language as both an interface and a medium for strategic reasoning, LLMs enable researchers to revisit classic problems and explore domains that were previously intractable. This emerging and promising area of research can be broadly categorized into two directions: the first (Subsection 5.1) explores how LLMs can expand traditional game-theoretic models, while the second (Subsection 5.2) focuses on leveraging LLMs to solve intractable game theory problems.
