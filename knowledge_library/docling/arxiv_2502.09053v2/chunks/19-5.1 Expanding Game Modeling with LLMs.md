## 5.1 Expanding Game Modeling with LLMs

Traditional game-theoretic models often operate within rigid numerical and symbolic representations that fall short of capturing the nuance and fluidity of human interaction. By introducing natural language as a modeling medium, LLMs offer a transformative shift: enabling expressive, adaptive, and context-aware representations of strategic behavior . This subsection explores how LLMs enrich the modeling landscape across three key domains: verbalized strategic interaction, preference elicitation in social choice, and semantic-enhanced economic mechanisms. Together, these works signal a move toward a more linguistically grounded and semantically rich game-theoretic paradigm.

5.1.1 Verbalized Strategic Interactions. Classical game theory's reliance on numerical information structures limits its ability to model human communication. Li et al. [219] addressed this by introducing a verbalized Bayesian persuasion (BP) framework for real-world games involving human dialogues. They represent BP as a mediator-augmented extensive-form game, with LLMs acting as sender and receiver. To solve this game efficiently, they develop a generalized equilibriumfinding algorithm that integrates LLMs with game solvers, incorporating verbalized commitment assumptions, obedience constraints, and information obfuscation. This approach enables game theory to model complex, language-driven interactions, enhancing its applicability to real-world scenarios like negotiations.

5.1.2 Preference Elicitation in Social Choice. In social choice, rigid preference elicitation with fixed alternatives restricts expressivity. Fish et al. [30] proposed 'generative social choice,' where LLMs generate textual options reflecting collective opinions, accommodating unforeseen alternatives. Their framework, supported by formal guarantees and empirical validation, demonstrates that LLMs can extract utilities from free-form text and create representative slates, achieving high agreement in applications like chatbot personalization. Boehmer et al. [220] extended this with PROSE, a system generating diverse, cost-effective slates under budget and query accuracy constraints. Using public deliberation datasets ( e.g., Polis), PROSE enhances scalability and user satisfaction in democratic processes, overcoming traditional social choice limitations.

5.1.3 Semantic-Enhanced Economic Mechanisms. Traditional auction and mechanism design models often assume fixed, black-box valuation functions, neglecting the semantic richness of real-world preferences. Sun et al. [221] introduced the Semantic-enhanced Personalized Valuation in Auction (SPVA) framework, where LLMs extract context-sensitive valuations from unstructured text ( e.g., reviews, product descriptions) using LLMs. This reduces valuation noise and improves utility in Vickrey auctions. Similarly, Lu et al. [31] extended mechanism design to natural language domains in peer-prediction settings, using LLMs to evaluate truthful reporting from free-form feedback, with applications in content moderation and community governance. Penna et al. [222] proposed Language Model Mechanisms (LMMs), where agents report in natural language, and LLMs compute outcomes and payments, maintaining incentive compatibility in high-dimensional, distributed environments. These advancements enrich economic mechanism design with semantic context.

5.1.4 Emerging Perspectives. These developments signal a paradigm shift in game-theoretic modeling. Lotfi et al. [223] argued that LLMs' linguistic and adaptive capabilities challenge assumptions like fixed communication protocols and fully rational agents. In simulated negotiations, language-mediated interactions produce emergent behaviors, such as spontaneous coordination or implicit collusion, which standard models fail to predict. This shift toward semantically rich, language-based systems, where agents reason and renegotiate rules via natural language, expands the boundaries of game theory, enabling new insights into complex strategic interactions.
