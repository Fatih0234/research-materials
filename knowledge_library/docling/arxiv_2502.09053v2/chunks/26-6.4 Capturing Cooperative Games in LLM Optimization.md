## 6.4 Capturing Cooperative Games in LLM Optimization

Current Landscape: As discussed in Section 3, many studies applying game theory to LLM optimization have primarily focused on competitive game formulations. While competition offers a natural and tractable modeling approach, cooperation presents an equally promising avenue for advancing LLM capabilities, which is underexplored.

Future Directions: Incorporating cooperative game-theoretic principles into the training and optimization of LLMs could yield both novel theoretical insights and practical performance gains. For example, in Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures, individual expert networks can be conceptualized as players in a cooperative game. Leveraging solution concepts such as the Shapley Value or the core could inform more principled router scheduling strategies, improving expert selection and load balancing while minimizing redundancy. Similarly, in ensemble learning and knowledge distillation settings, modeling sub-models as cooperative agents and applying fair credit assignment mechanisms could enhance collaboration among components, leading to improved generalization and computational efficiency.
