## 6.6 Leveraging LLMs as Oracles to Extend Theoretical Game Models

Current Landscape: As discussed in Section 5, recent studies have demonstrated the potential of LLMs to extend classical game-theoretic models into more realistic domains involving natural language. The core insight is that the LLMs' sophisticated language understanding and generative abilities let them serve as oracles that instantiate otherwise abstract components of game models, functioning as certain rules.

Future Directions: This approach paves the way for relaxing idealized assumptions by replacing theoretical constructs with practical, LLM-driven approximations. Such a substitution allows previously abstract models to be instantiated in real-world settings while preserving their approximate theoretical guarantees. Systematically exploring the use of LLMs as adaptable oracles could enable a new class of empirical, simulation-driven game-theoretic analyses. A particularly impactful application lies in computational mechanism design-for instance, in simulating complex auctions where bidder preferences are subtle and difficult to formalize. LLMs can emulate realistic bidder behavior across varying mechanisms, supporting rapid iteration and refinement of designs that were previously analytically intractable.
