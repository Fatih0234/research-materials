## 7 CONCLUSION

This survey has provided a comprehensive examination of the bidirectional interplay between game theory and large language models, addressing a significant gap in the existing literature. Through a novel structured taxonomy, we have systematically organized and elucidated the multifaceted relationship between these fields, highlighting their mutual reinforcement and synergistic potential. Our analysis demonstrates that game theory offers essential frameworks, such as equilibrium concepts, incentive design, and multi-agent interaction models, to formalize, analyze, and enhance LLM behaviors. Conversely, LLMs introduce unprecedented capabilities for simulating complex agents, approximating theoretical oracles, and scaling game-theoretic solutions in real-world environments. We hope this work inspires further exploration and collaboration at this dynamic intersection, paving the way for innovative developments in both domains.
