## 4.2 LLM-Agent Simulation Setup for the Public Goods Game

4.2.1 Multi-Agent LLM Architecture Implementation. When implementing the PGG in the multi-agent framework, we initialize it as

Humans follows. The moderator agent's name is "Moderator," and its public biography is simple: "This agent plays the role of the moderator". The moderator agent has no private biography. The moderator has an initial plan to start in the moderation room and wait for all players to make their contribution, and has instructions to then move to the game room and announce payoffs once all agents have made their contribution. Taxation

The player agents are given arbitrary alphabetical names (Alice, Bob, Casey, and David) and each have public biographies with a statement that the agent is playing a PGG-like game and contains their initial endowment, which all other agents can see. The player agents' private biography is blank by default, but is used to realize the priming condition of experiments - for example, the name priming is realized by adding to the agents private biography, "You are playing a game called the Taxation Game . "

The architecture used does not have an explicit turn-taking process. To implement the mechanics of turn-taking, player agents' have an initial plan to wait for the player before them to return from the moderation room. Player agents are ordered alphabetically by being told the player before them (in the case of Bob, Casey, and David) or by being told they are first (in the case of Alice). They also have instructions to move to the moderation room and make their contribution (with the payoff specified here for player agents to take into account) once the player before them has returned, and to not engage with any other player agents' in the game room until the Moderator comes to the room and payoffs are announced. In each agent loop , the agent thus waits for the player before them to come back from the contribution room before going themselves, tells the moderator their contribution (which the moderator records to their memory), then returns to the main room.

4.2.2 Data Collection. As the simulation progresses, all of the thoughts and actions of each player agent (and the moderator agent) are displayed in separate output logs, each representing one of the agents involved in the simulation. Each output log contains a plethora of information, ranging from the events each agents observed, their reactions to them, and the creation of new plans, but we are only interested in the contributions they make.

To collect data on the contribution amount of each agent, we used a script on each player agent's output logs. The script used string matching and regular expressions to look for when each agent was in the moderation room and the dollar amount said by the agent. This data was then output into a table. A human verified that the data was accurately transcribed by reading the sections identified by the script and making corrections as needed.
