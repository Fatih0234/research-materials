## 5 Study 2: Testing Multi-Agent Systems Ability to Transfer Effects from non-PGG Lab Experiments to Simulations of the PGG

To test whether LLMs can actually simulate human-like behavior and are not just parroting previously published lab experiments, we design two further experiments. These experiments take effects from lab experiments not containing the key word "public goods game." We then measure if LLMs are able to produce the expected outcomes in simulations of the PGG. We run two experiments; the first applies positive and negative priming methods used in other cooperation games, to assess if LLMs can generalize these effects to the PGG. The second tests priming effects from a one-shot PGG lab experiment, but over multiple rounds, incorporating the observed changes in priming effects over time from competition games. This approach confirms that the results in Study 1 were not simply due to LLMs parroting the results from a single lab experiment - it demonstrates that LLMs can integrate information from multiple various sources to simulate human-like behavior.
