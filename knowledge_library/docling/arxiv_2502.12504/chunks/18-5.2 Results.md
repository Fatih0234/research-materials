## 5.2 Results

5.2.1 Does priming LLM agents with a methodology used in nonPGG cooperation game lab experiments have the expected result in LLM simulations of the PGG?. In experiments of other cooperation games, priming participants via sentences alluding to "unity" resulted in participants being more generous than participants primed via sentences alluding to "proportionality" [4]. In ten simulations, LLM agents primed with the sentences alluding to "unity" (Alice and Bob) contributed on average approximately 65% of their initial endowment. In comparison, agents primed with the sentences alluding to "proportionality" (Casey and David) contributed on average only approximately 30% of their endowment to the public pool. The results are summarized in Figure 4.

Round #1

Average Contribution by Priming and Round

Avg. Contribution | "Teamwork"

• Avg. Contribution | "Taxation"

A t-test shows that the difference in contributions between the two groups is statistically significant at the p &lt; 0.01 level ( 𝑡 = 8 . 76 , 𝑝 &lt; 1e -9). From these results, we conclude that the effects of priming on humans is transferred from papers not involving the PGG to simulations of the PGG with LLM-agents. Rounds

5.2.2 Does the effect of priming over time, observed to fade in nonPGG competition game lab experiments, hold in LLM simulations of the PGG?. In experiments of competition games with human subjects, the effect of priming has been found to fade over time [17]. In ten simulations, LLM agents presented a five-round PGG as the "Teamwork Game" (Alice and Bob) on average contributed 75% of their initial endowment in the first round, compared to 55% of their initial endowment in the fifth round. In comparison, agents presented the PGG as the "Taxation Game" (Casey and David) contributed 30% of their initial endowment in the first round, compared to 45% of their initial endowment in the fifth round. Hence, for both priming conditions, the average contribution was closer to 50% of the initial endowment in the fifth round than in the first, meaning the effect of the priming was less pronounced in the fifth round than the first. The results are summarized in Figure 5.

Figure 5: Average contributions in the all five rounds rounds for either "Teamwork" and "Taxation" priming conditions. Average contributions in the fifth round are closer to 50% of the initial endowment, the average amount contributed without any priming [19]. Hence, the effects of priming appears to fade over time in simulations with LLM-agents.

T-tests show that the difference in contribution amount between the rounds is statistically significant for the "Teamwork" priming condition at the p &lt; 0.01 level ( 𝑡 = 4 . 32 , 𝑝 = 0 . 002) and for the "Taxation" priming condition at the p &lt; 0.05 level ( 𝑡 = -2 . 30 , 𝑝 = 0 . 047). A t-test also shows that there is a statistically significant difference in the first round contributions of players in either priming condition ( 𝑡 = 9 . 64 , 𝑝 &lt; 0 . 0000000001). Fromthese results, we observe that the effect of priming LLM agents fades over time, concluding that LLMs are not just parroting past literature, but are able to transfer the multi-round effect observed in non-PGG lab experiments to simulations of the PGG. The "Taxation" priming condition specifically suggests that the difference between first and fifth round contributions is not because contributions in PGGs with human subjects decrease over time [19], but rather that it is likely the consequence of a fading priming effect.
