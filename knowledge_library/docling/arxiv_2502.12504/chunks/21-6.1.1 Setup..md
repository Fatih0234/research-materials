## 6.1.1 Setup.

Classroom Simulation Setup. Towards simulating the behaviors in a classroom setting, we first try basic simulation setup with only one location, but find that expected student behaviors (specifically, cheating) are not present. Hence, we add a mechanism to the simulation setup - locations for private communication - to enable students to communicate with one another without the teacher overhearing and discuss the things that real students may discuss in private.

To simulate the classroom setting, we identify two main necessary components for the basic setup: (1) people, (2) a location, and (3) homework assignment and submission instructions. The simulation involves two types of people: one professor and multiple students (specifically, 3). These are all represented by separate LLM-agents, all located in the same location. Students are given various personality traits (over-achiever, procrastinator, or values work-life-balance) and can be affected by two perturbations (having a midterm or a particularly challenging assignment). The professor is instructed to announce the late-policy and make assignment announcements at a regular interval. Students are instructed to listen to assignment announcements at the interval at which the professor announces them, and to "work" on the assignments in the meantime. Students are able to converse with the professor and other students, although only by addressing all at the same time.

For the more complicated setup, we introduce using locations as a mechanism for private communication. The simulation requires three locations: (1) a classroom, where assignments are announced, (2) an office, where the professor goes while students "work", and

(3) a work room, where students "work." All students know these locations exist; the students can move between all of them, while the professor only moves between the classroom and office. The professor is instructed to announce the late-policy and make assignment announcements at a regular interval in the classroom, and to remain in the office otherwise. Students are instructed to listen to assignment announcements in the classroom at the interval at which the professor announces them, and then to be in the work room otherwise, with the option to move to the office to talk to or ask the professor questions.

Multi-Agent LLM Architecture Implementation. We implement the simulation by adapting the same architecture as in the previous studies. When implementing the classroom setting in the multiagent framework, we initialize it accordingly. In both setups, the professor agent's name is "Professor." The professor agent's public biography contains their late policy for assignments, as well as a general sentence indicating that they are the instructor for the course. The professor agent has no private biography. In the basic setup, the professor has an initial plan to announce their late policy and the first assignment's due date. The professor agent has instructions to answer student questions and to announce additional assignments at regular intervals (five total). The student agents are given arbitrary alphabetical names (Alice, Bob, and Casey). The student agents' public biographies contain their personality types, whereas their private biographies contain the perturbations as needed. Student agents are given an initial plan to listen to the late policy and first assignment announcement. Student agents have instructions to: (1) "work" on assignments, (2) listen to the professor's announcements of new assignments, and (3) state how many days late they will need to submit each assignment.

After adding separate office, work, and class rooms, we modify the instructions to each agent to utilize the ability to move between them appropriately. The professor agent has an initial plan to start in the classroom and announce their late policy and the first assignment's due date, then to move to the office. The professor agent has instructions to (1) answer student questions in the office, (2) move to the classroom at regular intervals to announce additional assignments, and (3) never enter the work room. Student agents are given an initial plan to listen to the late policy and first assignment announcement in the classroom. Student agents have instructions to: (1) work on assignments in the work room, (2) return to the classroom at regular intervals to hear announcements for new assignments, (3) state how many days late they will submit each assignment, and (4) use the office to talk to or ask questions to the professor.

Data Collection. As the simulation progresses, all of the thoughts and actions of each student agent (and the professor agent) are displayed in separate output logs, each representing one of the agents involved in the simulation. Each output log contains a plethora of information, ranging from the events each agents observed, their reactions to them, and the creation of new plans, but we are only interested in tracking the specific behavior of cheating, which occurs by LLM-agents requesting to see and/or copy other's work. To collect data on the presence of this behaviors, we manually read through each student agent's output logs. A human manually recorded whether or not cheating was suggested and formatted this information into a table.

6.1.2 Methodology. We run simulations with three different late policies: (1) a lenient late policy (LLP) in which assignments turned in late are not given any penalty, (2) a medium late policy (MLP) in which assignments are docked 10% for each late day, and (3) a harsh late policy (HLP) in which late assignments are not accepted. We also run simulations under three different perturbation conditions: (1) where students do not have any perturbations (P0), (2) where students have a midterm during the third assignment period (P1), and (3) where students have a midterm during the third assignment period and the second assignment is especially challenging (P2). We ran five simulations of each of the nine combinations of late policy and perturbation conditions (LLP-P0, LLP-P1, LLP-P2, MLP-P0, MLP-P1, MLP-P2, HLP-P0, HLP-P1, and HLP-P2) under two conditions: with or without locations. In each simulation, we recorded if any student proposed cheating at any point.

6.1.3 Results. In simulations with only one room, we found that students never suggested cheating, likely due to the professor always being in the same room as them. However, the introduction of locations changed this. In the lenient late policy condition, students still never suggested cheating, regardless of perturbations. In the medium late policy, students never suggested cheating in the no perturbation condition, but did so in one simulation in each of the one perturbation and two perturbation conditions. In the harsh late policy, students suggested cheating in all three perturbation conditions: students suggested cheating at an equal frequency in the no perturbation and one perturbation conditions, and the most in the two perturbation condition. The results are presented in Figure 6. From these results, we conclude that locations can be used a mechanism for private communication to observe emergent behaviors such as cheating (a "bad" form of cooperation), which can only occur if students are able to converse without the professor overhearing.
