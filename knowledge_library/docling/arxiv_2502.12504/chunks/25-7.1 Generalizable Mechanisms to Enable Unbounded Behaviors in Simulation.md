## 7.1 Generalizable Mechanisms to Enable Unbounded Behaviors in Simulation

Simulations of real-world scenarios are particularly valuable when they produce realistic human behaviors that were not explicitly prompted. We refer to these as "unbounded behaviors" because they occur outside the expected framework of the simulation. Such behaviors are difficult to predict with traditional models, but multiagent LLM systems have the unique potential to generate them. In Study 3, we observed unbounded behaviors such as cheating in a classroom simulation and shoppers neglecting to return carts in a parking lot.

However, in these scenarios, additional mechanisms were needed to enable the emergence of unbounded behaviors. For instance, we had to introduce private rooms to observe cheating in the classroom, and we had to add clear stakes (such as "you have an infant waiting in the car") to see agents failing to return shopping carts. If every simulation requires a custom mechanism to produce specific unbounded behaviors, the value of simulations diminishes -they would only reflect behaviors that researchers expect, thus undermining the purpose of simulation. However, if the mechanisms are

generalizable, they can be widely implemented, allowing simulations to still produce meaningful unbounded behaviors. The question remains: were the mechanisms we added general or specific? With only two examples, it's hard to draw definitive conclusions, but there is reason to believe they could be broadly applicable.

In the classroom simulation, the introduction of private rooms was necessary to observe cheating. In hindsight, it seems obvious that students would only cheat if they had a private space to communicate without getting caught. Broadly speaking, communication is a fundamental mechanism in society that enables many unexpected outcomes. The invention of the telephone, the internet, and even home-delivered mail has had significant effects on the economy (increasing global trade and commerce), employment (enabling remote work), and culture (connecting distant people). Any simulation that tests cooperation will likely need diverse communication channels (private, public, synchronous, asynchronous) to allow for various forms of interaction and collaboration.

In the shopping cart simulation, adding stakes was essential. Studies show that people with a child waiting in the car are less likely to return their cart. However, we initially did not see this effect in the simulation. Upon reflection, the condition "having a child" was too vague. If the child was 12 years old, there was little pressure to skip returning the cart. But if the child was 5 months old, there was significant urgency. When we clarified the child's age in the simulation, the unbounded behavior emerged for parents with a 5-month-old more frequently than for parents with a child of unspecified age. This outcome makes sense, as it was a flaw in the initial setup to specify only "having a child" without including age. To simulate unbounded behaviors effectively, simulations need enough contextual details for agents to understand the stakes and reason for their actions.

In the future, more work is needed to discover a set of mechanisms that enable simulations to exhibit rich, bounded human behavior. Communication channels and detailed contextual stakes are likely two such mechanisms, but there are probably many more that need to be discovered.
