## 7.2 How can policymakers benefit from imperfect simulations with multi-agent systems?

These experiments showed that multi-agent LLM simulations can replicate the direction of effects (though perhaps not the magnitude) and extend to situations not explicitly covered in the literature. They also have the capability to exhibit unbounded actions. These are all encouraging signs that these simulations could be a valuable tool for policymakers, but the reality is that they will never be perfect. The question is: can they still be useful despite their imperfections?

Even if simulations are not completely accurate, they can still serve as ideation tools to imagine different possible outcomes. Prospection - the ability to think and reason about the future-is a hallmark of human intelligence, yet it is something that many people struggle with. When thinking about the future, people often find it difficult to account for the complexity of multiple independent actors' decisions, fall prey to cognitive biases (such as optimism bias when they want a policy to succeed), and struggle to imagine novel situations for which they have little prior experience. Although

future thinking is important, it is cognitively taxing, and any aids might be better than relying solely on our limited cognition. LLM systems, while imperfect, are relatively fast, low-cost, and can run multiple scenarios. In many cases, a reasonable simulation is better than none at all.

If simulations are accurate in predicting the direction of effects and relative effect sizes (even if not their exact magnitude), they can still be valuable for testing different policies to determine whether they will be effective (even if not precisely how effective). This can be especially useful because some policies are known to fade quickly over time, becoming ineffective unless frequently renewed, while others persist by establishing new norms-such as making organ donation the default option instead of requiring an opt-in. A simulation, particularly one that tracks effects over time, could reveal these policy limitations. Additionally, simulations can expose potential negative externalities, such as added bureaucracy or unintentionally excluding participants (for example, when new market regulations make it harder for newcomers to enter).

Simulations can also serve as a boundary object that helps individuals from diverse backgrounds integrate their knowledge. Many complex scenarios involve various areas of expertise and perspectives. In a city, a proposal like introducing a bike lane affects many departments -- transportation, waste management, emergency route planning, and legal services. Instead of each department prioritizing its own concerns, a simulation might help different groups see how their concerns intersect, fostering a more collaborative discussion. Thus, simulations could function as a social glue for large organizations.

While there is much work to be done with policymakers to determine the value of imperfect simulations, there are reasons to believe they could be useful for tackling a challenging and important problem that currently has few affordable and accessible feedback mechanisms.
