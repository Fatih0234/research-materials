## 3 Experimental Framework

To rigorously evaluate belief-behavior consistency, we implement our framework using the Trust Game as a testbed (Berg et al., 1995). In this game, a role-playing LLM agent (the Trustor) decides how much money to send to another player (the Trustee). The amount sent is tripled, and the Trustee then decides how much to return. We simulate this scenario using multiple LLMs (Llama 3.1 8B/70B, (Grattafiori et al., 2024), Gemma 2 27B, (Team et al., 2024)) and a diverse set of synthetic personas with distinct demographic and personality attributes (see Section 3.2).

We structure our experiments at two complementary analysis levels. At the population level , we measure consistency by comparing the elicited marginal correlations between persona attributes and simulated behaviors (e.g., how age affects decisions in the Trust Game). At this level, we also test the effectiveness of using a simple, prompt-based approach to impose a desired belief onto the role-playing agent. At the individual level , we test if the LLM can accurately forecast its own actions when role-playing an individual persona across multiple rounds against clearly defined Trustee strategies.
