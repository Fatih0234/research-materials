## 3.1 Trust Game Environment

The canonical two-player Trust Game proceeds as follows. At the start of each round, Player A (also known as the Trustor ) receives an endowment E ($10, unless otherwise noted). The Trustor chooses an amount s ∈ [ 0, E ] to send to Player B (the Trustee ). The amount sent is tripled before reaching the Trustee, who then decides how much r ∈ [ 0, 3 s ] to return to the Trustor, keeping the remainder.

We simulate the Trustor using a role-playing LLM agent, providing it with a specific persona and the rules of the game. The Trustor agent is the first to act in the Trust Game; thus, its decision depends solely on its assigned persona, not on any prior moves by the Trustee. This design eliminates confounding effects from the other player's behavior. In single-turn scenarios (Section 4), we measure only how much money the Trustor chooses to send. In multi-turn scenarios (Section 5), the Trustee's responses are fully determined by fixed archetypes, as described in the individual-level experiment section (Section 5).

The role-playing prompt explicitly states the Trustor's role, the available action space (integer dollar amounts), and asks for a numeric response. We sample the model's output distribution with temperature scaling. Unless otherwise specified, we use T = 0.05 for replicability. Details of our output extraction and parsing methodology are provided in Appendix E. We additionally vary the endowment E to test robustness across initial amounts (prompt template provided in Appendix D.1).
