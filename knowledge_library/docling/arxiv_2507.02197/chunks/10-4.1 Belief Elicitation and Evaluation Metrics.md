## 4.1 Belief Elicitation and Evaluation Metrics

Wequery the language model to determine how it believes a persona attribute of interest (for example, participant age) influences decisions in the Trust Game. We apply three elicitation strategies (see Table 2). For each elicitation strategy S , we derive two structured outputs:

- Belief ranking π ( S ) t : an ordered list of values of attribute t , ranked by their predicted effect on the average amount of money transferred by the Trustor, in descending order.
- Belief effect size ( ̂ η 2 t ( S ) ): an estimate of the proportion of variance in the Trustor's decisions attributable to differences among the K groups defined by attribute t . We compute ̂ η 2 t ( S ) using the eta-squared ( η 2 ) effect size from analysis of variance (ANOVA; Girden, 1992), where the groups correspond to attribute levels.

Behavioral outcomes: We simulate the Trust Game for each persona pi , obtaining the transfer amount { s i } . The prompt template used for role-playing is given in Appendix B.1. From these we derive:

- Behavioral ranking π ∗ t : an ordered list of the discrete values of attribute t , ranked by the observed mean $ transfer among personas possessing each value, in descending order.
- Behavioral effect size η 2 t : the proportion of variance in the simulated transfers attributable to differences among the levels of attribute t , computed via eta-squared from a one-way ANOVA grouping by those levels.

Belief-Behavior Consistency Metrics: Finally, we assess belief-behavior consistency via two complementary statistics. First, we compute the Spearman correlation, which captures how well the elicited ranking matches the behavioral ordering. Second, we measure the absolute effect-size discrepancy quantifying the difference between predicted and observed effect sizes.
