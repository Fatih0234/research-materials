## 5.1 Trustee Archetypes For Belief Elicitation

In the Trust Game, the only source of stochasticity is the Trustee's behavior. By fixing the Trustee's strategy via a well-defined archetype, we fully specify the simulation environment. Following agent-based modeling literature (Chopra et al., 2024), we define simple, interpretable archetypes of the opponent player (Trustee) to ensure straightforward forecast evaluation, while avoiding the combinatorial explosion of conditioning on every possible response of the opponent.

For example, querying an LLM about its predicted action in round five of a Trust Game against a consistently uncooperative opponent requires us to pass in a precise, standardized description of that opponent's behavior to the LLM's prompt. Without such structure, comparisons between forecasted beliefs and simulated behavior would be unfair, as the LLM would be making predictions without access to the contextual information necessary to ground its responses.

We define three Trustee archetypes: M 1 , M 3, and M 5. Each archetype corresponds to a Trustee that returns $ i , where i is the subscript in the archetype's name (i.e., M 1 returns $1, M 3 returns $3, and M 5 returns $5), or their total available funds if less (see Appendix C.3 for details). These archetypes provide simple, controlled baselines for forecast elicitation and evaluation.
