Forecasting accuracy degrades over longer horizons. We observe a near-monotonic increase in MAE as the forecast horizon extends from one to six rounds, indicating that the belief-behavior consistency reduces when predicting actions ˆ sr further removed from the current game state (Fig. 1). This pattern holds across most model-archetype pairs, with the exception of Llama 3.1 8B under the M 3 and M 5 archetypes-where MAE remains flat or slightly decreases-suggesting that longer horizons could introduce accumulating uncertainty, which undermines a model's forecasting ability.

Figure 1: Trust Game: Model consistency across rounds, stratified by return constraint ($1, $3, $5). Each regression line represents MAE over six repeated rounds of the Trust Game for a given LLM-archetype combination. Lower MAE indicates higher forecasting consistency.
