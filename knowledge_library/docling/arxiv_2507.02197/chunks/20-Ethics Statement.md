## Ethics Statement

This work uses publicly available large language models (Llama 3.1, Gemma 2) and synthetic personas based on the GENAGENTS dataset, with no human subjects or private data involved. All simulations and elicited beliefs were generated using artificial agents.

We highlight limitations in belief-behavior consistency of LLM-based role-playing agents and propose methods to evaluate internal consistency prior to deployment. While some experiments include intentionally imposed priors to test model controllability, these do not reflect normative claims about group differences.

No sensitive or high-risk applications are addressed. The findings are intended to improve the reliability and transparency of synthetic simulations and are not substitutes for realworld behavioral data. Code and prompts will be released to support reproducibility and responsible use.
