## C.4 Individual-Level Belief Samples

To illustrate the structure of individual-level belief elicitation and how it varies with the behavior of the simulated counterpart, we present full forecast trajectories for a single agent interacting with three different Trustee archetypes.

The focal persona-a 25-year-old White male from Arkansas-is Catholic, slightly liberal, never married, currently employed but temporarily not at work, holds a high school degree, has less than $5,000 in wealth, and scores high on both conscientiousness and openness to experience. This persona remains fixed across all simulations.

We elicit predicted send amounts and justifications over six rounds of the Trust Game as this agent plays against each of the following Trustee archetypes:

- M 1 : Always returns at most $1 per round.
- M 3 : Always returns at most $3 per round.
- M 5 : Always returns at most $5 per round.

Each table below presents the round-by-round forecasts and accompanying explanations for one Trustee condition: Table 6 ( M 1 ), Table 7 ( M 3 ), and Table 8 ( M 5 ).
