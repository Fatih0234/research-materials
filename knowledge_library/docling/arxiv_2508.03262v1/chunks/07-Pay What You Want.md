## Pay What You Want

This study adopted Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) method to measure participants' economic choices and willingness to pay. PWYW is a participatory pricing mechanism where consumers voluntarily determine payment amounts based on their perceived value rather than fixed prices, and has been widely used as a representative experimental tool for behaviorally measuring willingness to pay in economics and consumer behavior research (Kim, Natter, and Spann 2009; Gerpott 2017). This method goes beyond simple product selection, requiring consumers to comprehensively consider various internal factors such as their preferences, economic constraints, fairness perceptions, social norms, and value systems when determining payment amounts. PWYW effectively implements experimental decision-making situations where these complex factors interact to influence willingness to pay. Particularly, by applying the PWYW context to cultural product consumption situations, Anonymous (2023)

designed the experiment to observe how participants' cultural tastes, experiences, knowledge, educational levels, and so-called cultural capital are reflected in actual consumption decisions. This enables collection of more realistic and coherent economic choice data rather than simple preference responses, providing experimental conditions suitable for evaluating LLMs' ability on simulating human behavior.
