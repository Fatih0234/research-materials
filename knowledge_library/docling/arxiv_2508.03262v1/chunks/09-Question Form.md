## Question Form

To construct realistic PWYW decision-making situations for cultural products, this study designed two scenarios: art exhibitions and music performances. Each scenario was structured to precisely measure participants' willingness to pay and choice behaviors, as presented in Figure 1. Specifically, three key questions were used to elicit participants' economic decision-making in each scenario. First, a binary question asking whether they are willing to attend the performance at the regular price. Second, a binary question asking whether they are willing to attend by paying their desired price. Third, for those who expressed willingness to attend in the second question, an open-ended numerical question asking how much they are willing to pay specifically. Additionally, multiple-choice questions were presented to identify reasons for unwillingness to attend, enabling analysis of how accurately LLMs can predict individual responses across various question formats. For the original korean questionnaire, refer to Supplementary Material.
