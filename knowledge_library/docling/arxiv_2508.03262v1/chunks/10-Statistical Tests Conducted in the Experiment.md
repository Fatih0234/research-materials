## Statistical Tests Conducted in the Experiment

Group-level human tendencies were estimated using the Heckman two-step model (Heckman 1976). In the first step, a probit regression was conducted with the second yes/no items for each scenario ( Q2 ) as dependent variables and persona attributes as independent variables to estimate the probability of viewing intention. In the second step, a linear regression was performed using the willingness-to-pay amounts ( Q2.1 ) as dependent variables, limited to participants agreed in Q2 . The inverse Mills ratio calculated from the first stage was incorporated to correct for self-selection bias. The model accounts for potential correlation between error terms in both stages, and sample selection bias occurs when this correlation is non-zero.
