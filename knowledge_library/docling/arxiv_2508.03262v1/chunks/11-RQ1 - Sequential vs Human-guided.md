## RQ1 : Sequential vs Human-guided

Using the above experiment, this section investigates whether LLMs can accurately predict individual human decisions under Sequential versus Human-guided interaction conditions. We address the detailed experimental procedures for validating this question, the characteristics of models used for evaluation, analytical methods, and results of each model's prediction performance against human responses.
