## Evaluation

We evaluated whether LLMs can predict human behavior with two aspects: individual-level accuracy and group-level tendencies . First, individual-level accuracy measures how accurately LLMs predicted individual participants' choices. Typically, the accuracy is measured with the proportion of cases where human responses and LLM responses completely match. Specifically, we calculate: (1) accuracy rate for each individual item, (2) accuracy rate for all binary items ( Q1 and Q2 ), and (3) Overall accuracy for correctly answering all three items, providing a multifaceted evaluation of LLM prediction performance.

Second, group-level tendencies measures the overall similarity between human data and simulated data by LLMs. Typically, we compared patterns of two regression models in estimating the influence of persona variables. Three metrics are used for this purpose: (1) Coefficient Sign Agreement (CSA) is the proportion of regression coefficients whose signs are matched, showing how similarly two models judged the direction of variable influence. (2) Statistical Significance Agreement (SSA) is the proportion of variables that are statistically significant in both models or insignificant in both, indicating the degree of agreement in important variable selection. (3) Jaccard Index (Jaccard 1908) calculates the overlap between two models using the set of significant variables, expressing how much the important variable sets themselves overlap as a value.
