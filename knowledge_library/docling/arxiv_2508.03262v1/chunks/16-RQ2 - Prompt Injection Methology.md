## RQ2 : Prompt Injection Methology

While RQ1 demonstrated LLMs' potential to reproduce human-like choices, it revealed limitations in accurately predicting individual-level. The improved performance in the Human-guided condition suggests that persona presentation and prompt structure significantly impact LLM prediction performance. Therefore, RQ2 systematically analyzes how different persona composition methods and prompt engineering affect LLMs' human behavior prediction.
