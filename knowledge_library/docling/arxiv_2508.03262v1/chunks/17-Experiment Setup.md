## Experiment Setup

Based on RQ1 results showing superior performance of Human-guided condition, RQ2 adopted this as the baseline setting for testing various persona composition and injection methods. All experimental conditions remained identical to RQ1, including models, API settings, and temperature parameters. The experiment examined two main axes. First, Persona Format included Survey Format (presenting the 65 collected persona items in structured form) and Storytelling Format (reconstructing the same information into biographical narratives). Second, Prompting Methods included na¨ ıve prompts (Base), CoT, RAG, and Few-shot Prompting (providing three response examples from similar personas). This resulted in seven experimental combinations: four techniques for Survey and three for Storytelling.
