## Result and Discussion

The RQ2 experimental results reveal several key patterns according to different persona format and prompting methods. For detailed results, refer to Table 2.

Effect of Persona Format Analysis of the overall results reveals that Survey Format consistently outperformed Storytelling Format across most conditions. Specifically, Survey Format demonstrated higher Overall Accuracy than Storytelling Format across the majority of models and prompting methods. For instance, GPT-4o recorded 4.02% in Survey Format compared to 0.19% in storytelling Format under Base conditions, while Qwen showed a substantial difference with 4.41% versus 1.34%, respectively. These findings suggest that structured information presentation better supports LLMs' ability in information processing.

At the individual item level, Survey Format exhibited marginally higher accuracy on binary questions compared to Storytelling Format. GPT-4o demonstrated slightly superior performance in Survey Format for Q2 (70.50%, 76.44%) relative to Storytelling Format (69.16% and 74.52%, respectively). Despite these modest differences at the item level, the formats produced substantial disparities in Overall Accuracy, indicating that cumulative effects across multiple decision points significantly amplify performance differences.

We suspect that the different Persona Format may hinder clarity of persona items. Specifically, Survey Format appears to facilitate LLMs' ability to understand persona information and establish clear connections to decision-making processes. In contrast, Storytelling Format may introduce atten- tional dispersion, diverting focus from decision-relevant information. This effect was particularly pronounced in shortanswer response items, where GPT-4o showed comparable performance between Survey Format ( M Q2.1 : 15.65%) and Storytelling Format (16.38%), yet differed substantially in overall consistency.

Effect of Prompting Methods The most notable finding is that prompting methods demonstrated only limited improvements compared to the Base approach. In the Survey Format, Few-shot prompting yielded mixed results: while it improved accuracy on specific items (GPT-4o showed improvement from 15.65% to 20.05% on M Q2.1 from Base to Few-shot), Overall Accuracy decreased in most cases (Base 4.02% vs Few-shot 1.72%). This suggests that providing additional examples may enhance performance on zero-shot Base method but fails to translate into comprehensive prediction accuracy across the complete decision-making process. Similarly, CoT and RAG techniques failed to provide consistent improvements. CoT occasionally resulted in performance degradation (GPT-4o Overall accuracy declined from Base 4.02% to CoT 2.49%), indicating that explicit reasoning steps may introduce additional sources of error rather than enhancing prediction capability. RAG maintained intermediate performance levels but showed no clear enhancement over the Base approach.

These findings collectively demonstrate that current prompting methods exhibit limited effectiveness in complex human behavior prediction tasks, suggesting that the challenge of persona-based behavioral simulation may require fundamentally different approaches beyond conventional prompting method.

Note on low Jaccard index The most critical finding is the consistently low Jaccard Index across both formats. Survey Format showed Jaccard scores ranging from 0.2-0.67, while Storytelling Format exhibited similar levels at 0.170.67. The Storytelling Format was originally designed to integrate persona information as a narrative, encouraging LLMs to consider comprehensive character backgrounds rather than isolated attributes. The intention was to prevent excessive focus on specific variables and promote more balanced persona understanding. However, the consistently low Jaccard Index across both formats suggests that LLMs possess fundamentally different abilities in variable selection and weighting compared to humans.

This finding extends beyond information presentation methods, revealing intrinsic limitations in current LLM architectures; they have low ability to understand and reproduce the complex and contextual characteristics of human decision-making processes. Regardless of whether information is presented in structured or narrative form, LLMs heavily rely on limited and biased portion of the given persona, exposing the inherent constraints of current technology in persona-based behavioral simulation. While LLMs can capture directional tendencies and statistical significance at the group level to some extent, their ability to identify decisionmaking factors that humans actually consider important remains unimproved despite modifications in persona format and prompting methods. So, the challenge of achieving

human-like behavioral simulation may require fundamental advances in model architecture and training paradigms, rather than incremental improvements in persona format or prompting method. The heavy reliance on limited portion of persona indicates that current LLMs may lack the humanlike mechanisms necessary for authentic persona-based decision modeling, highlighting a crucial area for future research in developing more sophisticated approaches to human behavior simulation.
