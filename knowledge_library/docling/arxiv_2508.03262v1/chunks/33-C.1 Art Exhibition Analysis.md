## C.1 Art Exhibition Analysis

We employed the Heckman two-step model to analyze participants' Willingness-to-Pay (WTP) for art exhibitions, addressing potential sample selection bias inherent in PayWhat-You-Want (PWYW) scenarios.

Step 1: Selection Equation (Probit Model) In this step, we compute the inverse Mills ratio ( λ i ), which can correct selection bias in the further steps. Specifically, step 1 begins with assuming the probability of participation using a probit regression:

where the dependent variable A Q2 is a binary indicator for willingness to participate in PWYW for art exhibition (1 = willing, 0 = not willing). And, Φ( · ) represents the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution.

For the analysis, we included the following independent variables in vector Z :

- edu f : Father's education level (1=middle school or below, 2=high school, 3=university, 4=graduate school) from A.1, Q8
- edu m : Mother's education level (same coding) from A.1, Q9
- edu s : Respondent's education level (same coding) from A.1, Q6
- art act dum : Art activity participation dummy derived from A.2, Q1 (1 if attended art exhibition ≥ 1 time in past year, 0 otherwise)
- art att ave : Average art attitude score, computed as mean of A.3, Q7, Q10-Q15, Q19, and Q24 (5-point Likert scale attitudes toward art exhibitions, artists' professions, and cultural sophistication)
- art qz tot sco : Art knowledge total score, sum of correct answers from A.4, Q28-Q29 ('Mona Lisa' and 'The Scream' painters, maximum score = 2)
- art ca edu b18 : Art cultural education before age 18, derived from A.5, Q2+Q4 (1 if received any art-related education in or outside school before age 18, 0 otherwise)
- art ca edu a19 : Art cultural education after age 19, derived from A.5, Q6+Q8 (1 if received any art-related education outside school after age 19, 0 otherwise)
- inc mo : Monthly personal income (categorical: 1=none to 9=over 7 million KRW) from A.1, Q10
- marital dum : Marital status dummy (1=married, 0=single/other) from A.1, Q3
- gen dum : Gender dummy (0=male, 1=female) from A.1, Q1

Now, we calculate the inverse Mills ratio ( λ i ) for each observation Z i . The λ i serves as a selection correction term that accounts for potential bias arising from non-random sample selection in the PWYW decision-making process. We obtain λ i as follows:

where N ( ·| 0 , 1 2 ) represents the probability density function (PDF) of the standard normal distribution.

Step 2: Outcome Equation (Linear Regression with Selection Correction) Step 2 estimates willingness to pay amounts, corrected for selection bias using inverse Mills ratio λ :

where the dependent variable art pwyw log wtp is the natural logarithm of WTP amount for art exhibition in KRW. And, X is the vector representing independent variables with all Z variables plus:

- social n : Social norm score from A.7, Q7 to Q10 (5point Likert scale measuring social influence on behavior)
- moral n : Moral norm score from A.7, Q2 to Q4 (5point Likert scale measuring moral obligations and conscience)
