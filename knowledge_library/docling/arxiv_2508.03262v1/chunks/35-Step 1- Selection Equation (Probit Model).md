where the dependent variable M Q2 is a binary indicator for willingness to participate in PWYW for music performance. And, the Z vector representing the following independent variables:

- edu f , edu m , edu s : Education variables (identical to art model)
- mus act dum : Music activity participation dummy derived from A.2, Q2 (1 if attended classical music/opera ≥ 1 time in past year, 0 otherwise)
- mus att ave : Average music attitude score, computed as mean of A.3, Q7, Q10-Q18, Q20-Q23, and Q25 (5point Likert scale attitudes toward classical music, opera, traditional music, and dance performances and professions, plus cultural sophistication)
- mus qz tot sco : Music knowledge total score, sum of correct answers from A.4, Q26-Q27 (Symphony 'Fate' composer and 'Rigoletto' composer, maximum score = 2)
- mus ca edu b18 : Music cultural education before age 18, derived A.5, Q1+Q3 (1 if received any music-related education in or outside school before age 18, 0 otherwise)
- mus ca edu a19 : Music cultural education after age 19, derived from A.5, Q5+Q7 (1 if received any musicrelated education outside school after age 19, 0 otherwise)
- Sociodemographic controls: inc mo , marital dum , gen dum (identical to art model)
