## Variable Transformations

- WTP Amount : We applied natural logarithm transformation to address skewness and heteroskedasticity.
- Cultural Education : Binary coding by re-categorizing experiences into formal (school) and informal (outside school) education experiences.
- Attitude Scores : Standardized averaging across relevant Likert scale items
- Knowledge Scores : Simple summation of correctly answered responses

Extracted Summary of Statistical Model For each successful model estimation, we extracted:

- ρ : Correlation between error terms in selection and outcome equations
- σ : Standard deviation of outcome equation error term
- Wald χ 2 : Statistics from the test of overall model significance
- McFadden R 2 : Pseudo R-squared about the fitness of selection equation
- Log likelihood: Indicator of fitness of statistical model
- Sample composition: N selected and N nonselected observations
- The statistical significance of the inverse Mills ratio ( λ ): Whether sample selection bias correction is necessary for valid inference
