## D.1 Survey Format

In the Survey format condition, persona information was presented in a structured question-answer format in Korean, directly mirroring the original questionnaire structure used in the human experiment. Each persona was input as a systematic compilation of responses across all 65 survey items from the seven main categories described in Section A, maintaining the original Korean language to ensure linguistic consistency with the human experimental conditions.

Thus, the persona information was structured as follows:

```
What is your gender? : [Male/Female] What is your age? : [Age in years] ...
```
