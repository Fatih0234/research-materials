ABMis a computational approach to simulate interactions among autonomous agents within complex systems, enabling the study of emergent behaviors and social dynamics (Gilbert, 2019). From a computer science perspective, ABM integrates agent-based computing, social sciences, and computer simulation, fostering cross-disciplinary research (Davidsson, 2002). In the social sciences, ABM serves as a 'third way' of research, complementing argumentation and formalization by enabling the modeling of complex processes and emergent phenomena (Gilbert &amp; Terna, 2000). In economics, ABM has evolved into agent-based computational economics, modeling dynamic economic systems and revealing insights into market behaviors like strategic interactions and collective learning (Tesfatsion, 2006; Tesfatsion &amp; Judd, 2006). Enhancements in agent design through behavioral economics and empirical data integration have made ABM simulations more realistic and applicable to complex social and economic systems (Steinbacher et al., 2021). With its wide applications, ABM remains a promising research area and motivates our work. Refer to Appendix E.1 for more works on ABM.

Recently, integrating LLMs into ABM has emerged as a promising direction to enhance the realism and adaptability of agents by improving environmental perception, human alignment, action generation, and evaluation (Gao et al., 2024; Nisioti et al., 2024). For example, PsychoBench (Huang et al., 2023) evaluates psychological traits; Generative agents (Park et al., 2023) simulate interactive social behaviors; and OASIS (Yang et al., 2024), Sotopia (Zhou et al., 2024), and EconAgent (Li et al., 2024) extend these ideas to large-scale simulations and economic and social reasoning. In the agent-based market domain, models like StockAgent (Zhang et al., 2024) and AuctionArena (Chen et al., 2023) test strategic and adaptive decision-making. See Appendix E.2 for more related works. Shachi's contribution is distinct from both general-purpose agent toolkits and ML engineering frameworks. General frameworks like AutoGen (Wu et al., 2024), Concordia (Vezhnevets et al., 2023), and EDSL (Expected Parrot, 2023) are designed for conversational task automation or game-master-led interactions, not the specific requirements of reproducible social simulation. In contrast, frameworks like MLE-Dojo (Qiang et al., 2025) focus on LLM training and engineering workflows, rather than the simulation and analysis of emergent social phenomena. Shachi bridges this gap with an architecture centered on a standardized agent-environment interface and environment-mediated communication, uniquely tailored for the reproducible and systematic study of these dynamics.
