## 3 SHACHI: A METHODOLOGY FOR MODULAR AGENT-BASED MODELING

To enable principled experimentation, we introduce Shachi, a methodology that formalizes the design and evaluation of LLM-based agents in ABM. Shachi is built on the core principle of decoupling the agent's internal architecture from the environment, which we achieve through a standardized interface and a modular component-based design for the agent itself. Figure 2 presents an overview.
