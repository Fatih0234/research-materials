## 3.3 ANALYZING SYSTEMATICALLY ACROSS SOCIAL COMPLEXITY

A core component of our methodology is a standardized testbed for evaluating agent architectures. To this end, we present a benchmark suite of ten tasks, adapted from prior work, and structured into three levels of increasing social complexity. This tiered structure is a deliberate design choice that allows researchers to isolate cognitive variables and systematically analyze agent behavior, from individual rationality to complex social dynamics. Details of each task and setup are in Appendices A and B.

Level I: Single-Agent Baselines. Tasks at this level feature a single agent in a controlled environment. They serve as the primary setting for calibrating and validating the core cognitive components of an agent's architecture. Here, researchers can systematically probe how different Configs (e.g., personas), Memory implementations, or available Tools affect individual reasoning and behavior, free from the confounding variables of social interaction.

Level II: Non-Communicative Multi-Agent Dynamics. This level introduces multiple agents into a shared environment where they interact only indirectly through their impact on the environment state S E t . These settings are designed to test an agent's ability to engage in strategic reasoning based purely on observations. They allow for the study of emergent phenomena like implicit coordination or competition, where agents must infer the strategies of others.

Level III: Communicative Multi-Agent Systems. The final level involves rich, direct communication, mediated through the environment. These tasks evaluate the entire socio-cognitive architecture, testing the interplay between language use, memory, and strategic action. They are essential for simulating sophisticated social phenomena such as negotiation and coalition formation.

Together, this structured benchmark provides a concrete pathway for conducting reproducible research. By leveraging the modularity of Shachi, researchers can now systematically compare how a specific architectural choice (e.g., adding a long-term memory module) impacts agent performance and behavior across all three levels of social complexity.
