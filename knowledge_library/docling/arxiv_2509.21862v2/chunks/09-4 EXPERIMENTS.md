## 4 EXPERIMENTS

Our experiments demonstrate the utility of the Shachi methodology in two parts. First, we perform foundational validation, confirming the framework's reproducibility by replicating prior work and its comparability through cross-task generalization studies. Having established this baseline, we then showcase how Shachi enables novel scientific inquiries, culminating in a simulation of a real-world U.S. tariff shock that establishes the methodology's external validity.
