## 4.2.2 LIVING IN MULTIPLE WORLDS

Experimental Setup We introduce a set of shared agents that operate across two distinct environments: StockAgent and OASIS. Unlike typical settings where agents act in only one environment, agents here cycle between both. In each cycle, agents first observe the StockAgent environment, make trading decisions, and apply their actions. Then, the group moves to OASIS, where agents observe the social media, respond, and act. This loop repeats, with each agent carrying its internal states across environments, allowing knowledge or strategies learned in one context to influence behavior in the other. StockAgent settings follow those in Section 4.1, with stock A representing a 10-year chemical stock and stock B representing a 3-year tech stock. The OASIS environment is described in Appendix B.10, where the main topic is Amazon's newly established physical stores. We report results averaged over three independent trials.

Experimental Results We found that allowing agents to participate in multiple environments led to emergent behaviors that reflect cross-domain influence. Figure 4 shows that, with OASIS present, stock prices rise less than in the StockAgent-only setting. This is surprising to us, as we expected that introducing the Amazon topic would cause agents to buy more of the tech-related stock (stock B), leading to a surge in its price. On the other hand, Table 3 gives more detailed information under the hood: (1) Introducing social media increased market activity, as evidenced by the increased volume in both stocks; (2) The introduced Amazon topic caused agents to show more willingness to buy the tech stock and to become reluctant to sell, which is supported by the increase in #Buys and the decrease in #Sells for stock B; (3) In contrast, this topic increased both the willingness to buy and sell stock A. This information is more in line with our intuition than with the price movements.

In terms of agent behavioral changes in OASIS, we observed that some agents began tweeting about Amazon stock, blending financial observations with social commentary. Other agents responded with comments, echoing and endorsing the post, suggesting that economic actions in one environment can organically propagate into social discourse in another. The following text box 1 shows the agent logs discussed, where the agents' posts and comments are labeled in blue and red.

Our results reveal that while agent-level behaviors align with intuitive financial logic, system-level outcomes do not necessarily follow, highlighting the importance of empirical simulation in social science research. At the same time, our exploratory study demonstrates Shachi's capacity for rich, layered simulations by supporting agents that live across multiple interconnected worlds.

Table 3: Change in Key Indicators. Volume refers to the number of matched orders, while #Buys/#Sells are the numbers of submitted buy/sell orders. Changes are reported as percentage changes of treatment (w/ OASIS) relative to control (w/o OASIS).

| Indicator   | % ∆ (Stock A)   | % ∆ (Stock B)   |
|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Volume      | +10.0%          | +20.0%          |
| #Buys       | +8.4%           | +6.1%           |
| #Sells      | +6.6%           | -8.5%           |
