## 4.2.3 ESTABLISHING EXTERNAL VALIDITY: SIMULATING A U.S. TARIFF SHOCK

Experimental Setup We use StockAgent as our testbed, and simulate a 5-day trading period (April 1-5, 2025) surrounding a tariff shock. We conduct a cumulative ablation study across four settings:

1. Base: Agents from the standard StockAgent task with no extra information.
2. Base + Config: Agents are exposed to a pre-announcement news headline about imminent tariffs, added to their configuration prompt.
3. Base + Config + Memory: Agents are additionally equipped with memory containing a summary of academic research on how tariffs negatively impact markets (Amiti et al., 2021).
4. Base + Config + Memory + Tool: Agents are finally given access to a news-retrieval tool that provides daily updates on the escalating trade tensions.

This design isolates the impact of each component, from a simple awareness of the event (Config) to possessing deep knowledge (Memory) and receiving real-time information (Tools). For each setting, we run 5 trials and report the mean. Details of prompts and data sources are in Appendix C.4.

Simulation Results and Analysis We report the average ratio of buy to sell orders across days in the order book to gauge the agents' enthusiasm for the market. The results are summarized in Table 4. Comparing the 2nd and 3rd columns, we can

Table 4: Buy-to-Sell Ratios (Cols. 2-3) and Changes (Cols. 4-5) .

| Setting   |   Stock A |   Stock B | ∆ Stock A        | ∆ Stock B        |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------------|------------------|
| #1        |      0.99 |      0.73 | -                | -                |
| #2        |      0.51 |      0.45 | -0.48 (w.r.t #1) | -0.28 (w.r.t #1) |
| #3        |      0.62 |      0.59 | +0.11 (w.r.t #2) | +0.14 (w.r.t #2) |
| #4        |      0.44 |      0.55 | -0.18 (w.r.t #3) | -0.04 (w.r.t #3) |

see that the agents prefer Stock A to B in settings #1 to #3, but this preference flipped in setting #4. The last two columns reveal more insights: (i) The 2nd row shows that changing the agents'

configuration so that they become aware of the tariff policy caused the agents to become more likely to sell. (ii) On the other hand, the 3rd row indicates that when agents are given academic knowledge, they become less reactive to the raw news, softening their bearish behavior. (iii) The last row is the most interesting to us. It shows that having access to daily news altered the agents' preference again, with Stock B showing a smaller drop than Stock A, creating a large difference between them.

Comparison with Real-World Data The outcome of our most complete simulation (#4) strongly aligns with real-world events. To establish the external validity of our method, we compare the simulated company performance with actual market data. To identify realistic counterparts for Stocks A and B, we first used ChatGPT to suggest companies matching their profiles (see Appendix C.4 for our prompt) and then manually verified the results. While these companies are not exact matches, they closely align with the stated profiles. The real-world results are supportive of our simulation results. The results are in Table 5, notice that since 4/5 is a weekend, 4/7 therefore corresponds to 4/5 in our simulation. Specifically, as shown in the return column of the real-world tables below, both Stock A and Stock B prices declined but Stock B experienced a smaller drop.

The results from this experiment provide three key takeaways. First, it demonstrates Shachi's flexibility, as each cognitive component (Config, Memory, and Tools) was used to systematically introduce new layers of information and influence agent behavior. Second, the resulting behaviors were insightful, evolving from a simple sell-off to a sophisticated market reaction that aligned with real-world events. Finally, this progression offers a powerful analogy for human cognition: setting #2 mirrors a person hearing the news without much economic literacy, following the panicked herd and exacerbating market meltdown; setting #3 resembles someone with in-depth economics knowledge, observing more before acting; setting #4
