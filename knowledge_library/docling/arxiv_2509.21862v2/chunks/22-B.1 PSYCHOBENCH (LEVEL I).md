## B.1 PSYCHOBENCH (LEVEL I)

Description PsychoBench (Huang et al., 2023) evaluates the psychological portrayal of LLMs, drawing from psychometric research to examine their human-like psychological traits.

Method It systematically measures thirteen psychological dimensions categorized into personality traits (e.g., Big Five Inventory, Dark Triad), interpersonal relationships (e.g., Bem's Sex Role Inventory), motivational tendencies (e.g., General Self-Efficacy), and emotional abilities (e.g., Emotional Intelligence Scale). The methodology involves administering psychometric scales directly via prompts. Crucial experimental parameters include detailed instructions for Likert-scale responses, randomized question order to ensure robustness, and strict control of model inference temperature (set to zero or near-zero).

Experimental Settings For the reproduction study reported in Table 1, we follow the original setup and use Llama-2-13b-chat-hf as the LLM component without a memory component. The task includes neither config nor tool components. We fix the LLM temperature to 0, test 10 random seeds for question ordering, and average the results. We compute the MAE between the scores obtained with Shachi (Ours) and those presented in the original paper across all psychological subscales. We add a naive baseline that answers each prompt by randomly selecting from the available choices. It takes a few minutes for the LLM to complete all psychometric scales.
