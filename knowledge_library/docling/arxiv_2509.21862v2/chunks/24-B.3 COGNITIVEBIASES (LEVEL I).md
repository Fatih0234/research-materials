## B.3 COGNITIVEBIASES (LEVEL I)

Description CognitiveBiases (Malberg et al., 2024) evaluates how LLMs exhibit 30 well-known cognitive biases, motivated by the increasing use of LLMs in high-stakes decision-making.

Method It specifically measures biases such as anchoring, framing, and 28 others commonly identified in psychology and behavioral economics. The core methodology employs a systematic framework that generates and administers 30,000 bias-specific test cases across 200 distinct decisionmaking scenarios, comparing model responses under control vs. treatment conditions. Crucial parameters include the explicit control/treatment designs for each bias, two standardized answer scales (7-point Likert or 11-point percentage), and reversed option orders to account for position bias, ensuring reproducibility and comprehensive coverage.

Experimental Settings For the reproduction study in Table 1, we follow the original setup and use GPT-4o-mini ( gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 ) as the LLM component without a memory component. The task includes neither config nor tool components. The LLM temperature is fixed at 0. We run the evaluation under three random seeds for question ordering and report the average. We measure MAE between the bias scores obtained with Shachi (ours) and those in the original paper across 30 biases. We include a naive baseline that responds to each prompt by randomly sampling from the available choices. Evaluating all 30 biases requires roughly one hour.
