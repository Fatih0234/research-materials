## B.4 EMOTIONBENCH (LEVEL I)

Description EmotionBench (Huang et al., 2024) evaluates how LLMs respond emotionally to various real-life situations, drawing from emotion appraisal theory to examine their alignment with human-like emotional reactions.

Method It measures eight key positive and negative emotions (anger, anxiety, depression, frustration, jealousy, guilt, fear, embarrassment) and tracks how situational contexts raise or lower these emotions compared to a default baseline. It uses self-report scales (e.g., PANAS), first measuring a model's default emotional state, then presenting situational prompts, and finally re-measuring changes in emotional scores.

Experimental Settings For the reproduction study reported in Table 1, we follow the original setup and use GPT-3.5-turbo ( gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 ) as the LLM component without a memory component. The task includes neither config nor tool components. We compute MAE between the eight key positive and negative emotion scores obtained with Shachi (Ours) and those reproduced with their original code on the PANAS scale. We add a naive baseline that answers each prompt by randomly selecting from the available choices. Evaluating the LLM's affective state takes roughly one minute.
