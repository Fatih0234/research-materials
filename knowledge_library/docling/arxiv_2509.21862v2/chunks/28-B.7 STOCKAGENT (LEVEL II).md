## B.7 STOCKAGENT (LEVEL II)

Description StockAgent (Zhang et al., 2024) is a large language model-based multi-agent system that simulates real-world stock trading under dynamic market conditions.

Method Specifically, it runs event-driven simulations where LLM-driven agents sequentially make loans, buy, sell, predict, and post and check forum decisions, while the market data and stock prices evolve daily. The framework models two distinct stocks: Stock A, a 10-year chemical stock, and Stock B, a 3-year tech stock, dynamically simulating their price fluctuations. Notable parameters include initial agent capital allocations, loan-to-value ratios, interest rates, and real-world-like events (e.g., financial reports).

Experimental Settings In the reproduction study reported in Table 1 and Figure 7, we follow the original setup and use GPT-3.5-turbo ( gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 ) as the LLM component with buffer memory component (length 3). The task contains both config and tool components. Our Shachi implementation exposes a forum API as the tool: each agent autonomously decides whether to read comments posted the previous day about the stock market. For config, the environment assigns each agent one of four investment stylesConservative , Aggressive , Balanced , or Growth-Oriented . We fixed random seeds and event sequences to match the original study. The simulation runs for 10 days with three sessions per day, involving 50 agents and 1,500 rounds. We average session-level price changes over three seeds and compute MAE between the session-by-session price dynamics of stocks A and B produced by Shachi (ours) and those reproduced with the authors' source code. As a baseline, we remove the tool and memory modules from the agents to isolate their impact on performance. For our cross-task agent study in Table 2, we deploy 50 agents-25 powered by GPT-4o ( gpt-4o-2024-08-06 ) and 25 by GPT-3.5-turbo ( gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 ). To quantify volatility, we calculate the price change rate for Stocks A and B between the first and final sessions and average the two rates. Simulating 1,500 rounds required several hours.
