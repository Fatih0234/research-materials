## B.8 AUCTIONARENA (LEVEL II)

Description AuctionArena (Chen et al., 2023) evaluates the strategic planning and execution capabilities of LLM agents within a dynamic auction environment, motivated by the need for realistic benchmarks of sequential decision-making in competitive scenarios.

Method The environment specifically assesses skills such as resource allocation, risk management, and adaptive strategic reasoning. The methodology employs a simulation of open ascending-price auctions where agents act as bidders, making decisions based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) framework. Crucial parameters include item valuation (distinguishing between cheap and expensive items), intentional overestimation of item value to simulate 'winner's curse', and explicit prioritization strategies that agents dynamically adjust after each round.

Experimental Settings For the reproduction study reported in Table 1, we follow 'Standard Competition' setting, where the evaluated agent (GPT-4-turbo, gpt-4-1106-preview ) competes directly against GPT-3.5-turbo ( gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 ) and GPT-4-turbo ( gpt-4-1106-preview ) agents. All agents use a chat-history memory (window 20, token 10,000). The environment supplies a config component but no tools. As for the config, each agent is assigned one of two strategies: profit-first - maximize final profit, or item-first - win the most items. We fix the temperature at 0, randomly assign the item order, and use the TrueSkill system to quantify agent performance across 10 auctions with different item sequences. As a baseline, we repeat this comparison while removing the agent's memory module to isolate its impact on performance. As for Figure 7, we use the result for GPT-4 ( gpt-4-0613 ) agent in the competition against GPT-3.5-turbo ( gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 ) and GPT-4 ( gpt-4-0613 ), with items ordered by descending price. For our cross-task agent study in Table 2, we use a TrueSkill score of GPT-4o ( gpt-4o-2024-08-06 ) in 'Standard Competition' setting. A three-agent, ten-item auction with a $20,000 budget takes about 20 minutes to run.
