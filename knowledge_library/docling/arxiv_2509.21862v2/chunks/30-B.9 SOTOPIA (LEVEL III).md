## B.9 SOTOPIA (LEVEL III)

Description Sotopia (Zhou et al., 2024) introduces an open-ended role-play environment with a multidimensional evaluation framework to simulate complex social interactions and systematically measure LLM agents' social intelligence.

Method In the original Sotopia implementation, at every turn, it concatenates the entire dialogue history from all agents into a single prompt. In Shachi, by contrast, memory management is an agent-side responsibility, so the environment supplies only the most recent message. The evaluation result consists of seven metrics (SOC, SEC, FIN, REL, KNO, GOAL, and BEL).

Experimental Settings For the Table 1 experiments, we follow the original setup and use GPT4 ( gpt-4-0613 ) as the LLM component with a buffer memory component (all history with a 16,000 token limit). The task includes neither config nor tool components. To faithfully reproduce Sotopia inside Shachi, our reproduced agent (the agent reported as 'Shachi (Ours)' in Table 1 and the 'Sotopia' line in Table 2) restructures the full conversation history into one prompt in the same format. We set the LLM temperature to 1. We consider the MAE between the results reported in the original paper and our experiments. For our cross-task agent study in Table 2, we utilize GPT-4o ( gpt-4o-2024-08-06 ). We apply min-max normalization using the maximum and minimum values defined for each metric and then calculate the overall average across these metrics. The evaluation takes approximately 20 minutes.
