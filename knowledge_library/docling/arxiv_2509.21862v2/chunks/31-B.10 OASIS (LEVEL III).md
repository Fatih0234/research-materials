## B.10 OASIS (LEVEL III)

Description OASIS (Yang et al., 2024) is a large-scale multi-agent simulation benchmark for studying how up to one million LLM-based agents interact on social media platforms, focusing on information propagation, group polarization, and herd effects.

Method OASIS simulates large-scale social media environments by combining an environment server, a recommendation system, and a time engine. Each user is modeled as an LLM-based agent

with a 21-type action space (e.g., posting, commenting, following), whose behavior and memory evolve in real time. By supporting up to one million agents, OASIS facilitates the study of complex emergent phenomena, such as information spreading, group polarization, and herd effects, in both X and Reddit-like settings. In our experiment, we utilize an X-like setting.

Experimental Settings In our experiments, OASIS is employed in both Sections 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 under the same setup, following one of the original settings. Specifically, we use one influential agent who posts about Amazon ('report: amazon plans to open its first physical store in new york URL'), and its followers respond, with limited connectivity among the followers themselves. We use several models as the LLM component based on experiments with a chat-history memory (window 5, token limit 100,000). The environment supplies a config component but no tools. As for the config, each agent is assigned a distinct profile, such as '@ohiostate alumni. High tech marketer, salon entrepreneur, &amp; web design enthusiast. Fashion &amp; food are my passions. Views are my own.' In Section 4.2.1, we use GPT-4o-mini ( gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18 ), while Section 4.2.2 employs GPT-3.5-turbo ( gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 ) and GPT-4o ( gpt-4o-2024-08-06 ). Ten iterations with 111 agents complete in a few minutes.
