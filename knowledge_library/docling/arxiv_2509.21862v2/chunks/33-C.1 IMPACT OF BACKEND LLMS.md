## C.1 IMPACT OF BACKEND LLMS

Experimental Setup For EconAgent, we replaced the single model in the original study with a set of widely used models. All other settings remain unchanged: an economy of 100 simulated agents evolves over 240 months, and we track both standard macro-indicator trajectories and the emergence of two canonical macroeconomic regularities: the Phillips Curve (Phelps, 1967) and Okun's Law (Okun, 1963).

Experimental Results Figure 6 visualizes how the choice of backend LLM affects macroeconomic patterns and indicators. All LLM-based agents collectively show behaviors in accordance with both Phillips Curve and Okun's Law. Nonetheless, the curves differ in detail: intercept shifts in the Phillips Curve point to varying baseline unemployment rates, while slope changes in Okun's Law indicate differing GDP-unemployment trade-offs. Moreover, although most LLM backends produce similar variations of indicators, GPT-4.1 Nano yields consistently higher unemployment, and GPT-4.1 delivers markedly stronger GDP growth. Our Shachi framework's modular separation of concerns allows easy backend change with a single configuration line, unlike ad-hoc setups, where replacing the LLM typically means re-implementing or realigning several parts of the agent pipeline. This streamlined flexibility enables cleaner comparisons and faster iteration, like what we find here.
