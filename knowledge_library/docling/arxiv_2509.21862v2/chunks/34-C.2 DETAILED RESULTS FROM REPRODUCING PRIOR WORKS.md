## C.2 DETAILED RESULTS FROM REPRODUCING PRIOR WORKS

Experimental Setup We selected eight out of the ten tasks in our benchmark suite for reproduction. These tasks were chosen primarily because they report concrete, quantitative metrics that make it feasible to assess reproduction fidelity in a principled way. All agents were implemented within Shachi using modular combinations of LLM, memory, tools and configuration components, preserving as much of the original behavioral logic as possible. The baselines are variations of the original agents (e.g., removing all the components and making it a thin wrapper of LLM) or agents with randomized behaviors.

Experimental Results Table 1 shows the reproduction error for all selected tasks, measured by mean absolute error (MAE) between the original and the reproduced results. Across all tasks, Shachi achieves consistently lower error than the baseline, often by a large margin. This indicates that Shachi accurately preserves the original agents' quantitative outputs, validating its reliability.

While Table 1 provides an aggregated view of reproduction fidelity, we also present 'zoomed-in' results in Figure 7 to illustrate how well Shachi captures the dynamics of the original simulations. On the left, we visualize the price trajectories of two stocks in the StockAgent task, showing a close match between the original and Shachi-reproduced trends over time. On the right, we show that Shachi also replicates fine-grained behavior patterns during the sequential auction of ten items, as shown in the heatmap of averaged priority scores for the remaining items across bidding rounds in AuctionArena. These qualitative visualizations reinforce that Shachi not only matches the original quantitative outputs but also captures the underlying temporal and structural patterns.

Left: Evolution of the two stock prices in StockAgent, comparing the original study with our Shachi reproduction; Right: Reported and reproduced heatmaps of priority scores and their changes before each bidding round in AuctionArena (descending). Together, these results illustrate how well Shachi captures the dynamics of the original simulations.
