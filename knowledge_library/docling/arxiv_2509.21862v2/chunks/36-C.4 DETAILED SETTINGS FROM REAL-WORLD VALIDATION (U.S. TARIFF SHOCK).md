## C.4 DETAILED SETTINGS FROM REAL-WORLD VALIDATION (U.S. TARIFF SHOCK)

Experimental Setup We use the StockAgent task as our testbed, and simulate a 5-day trading period (April 1-5, 2025) surrounding a tariff shock. We conduct a cumulative ablation study across four settings: (1) Base: Agents from the standard StockAgent task with no extra information. (2) Base + Config: Agents are exposed to a pre-announcement news headline about imminent tariffs, added to their configuration prompt. (3) Base + Prompt + Memory: Agents are additionally equipped with memory containing a summary of academic research on how tariffs negatively impact markets (Amiti

et al., 2021). (4) Base + Prompt + Memory + Tool: Agents are finally given access to a news-retrieval tool that provides daily updates on the escalating trade tensions.

Details about the information used in the agent settings are as follows:

- Config in setting #2: In prompt, we incorporate the news title 'Trump's 'Liberation Day' Tariffs Loom; Treasury Yields Fall President Trump has set a deadline of Wednesday to announce sweeping tariffs. ' from WSJ 2 . This news was released before the massive sell-off in April.
- Memory in setting #3: In augmented memory, we use a summary of the paper 'Trade protection, stock-market returns, and welfare' (Amiti et al., 2021) produced by gpt-4o (see text box 2). The last revision date of this paper was also before the April sell-off.
- Tool in setting #4: We collected WSJ news 345 before the April sell-off to store in a news database, the news-fetching tool grabs one news on each day and adds that to the agents' input.

For each setting, we run 5 trials and report the mean. Each trial is run for 5 simulation days (April 1-5, 2025). More concretely for setting #4, the agents use the news-fetching tool to see the news (footnote 3) on April 2nd, the news (footnote 4) on April 3rd, and the news (footnote 5) on April 4th.
