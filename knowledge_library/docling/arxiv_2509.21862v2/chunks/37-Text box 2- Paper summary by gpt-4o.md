NBER Working Paper 28758, titled "Trade Protection, Stock-Market Returns, and Welfare" by Mary Amiti, Matthieu Gomez, Sang Hoon Kong, and David Weinstein, studies the impact of tariff announcements during the U.S.-China trade war on financial markets and welfare. Key findings:

- Tariff announcements significantly reduced U.S. stock prices (-11.5% cumulatively across 11 key events).
- They also triggered a drop in nominal and real government bond yields (flight to safety).
- Firms exposed to China saw worse stock returns and future business outcomes (profits, employment, productivity).
- The authors develop a dynamic specific-factors model showing that welfare loss stems not just from price distortions but also from expected future declines in productivity (TFP).
- Estimated U.S. welfare loss from the trade war is 3.0%, with 1.1 percentage points attributed to expected TFP decline.

The paper uses a novel approach of mapping financial market responses to welfare analysis, bridging asset pricing models with trade theory.
