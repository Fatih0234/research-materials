## E.1 ABM WITHOUT LLMS

During the 1970s and 1980s, ABM emerged as a powerful way to study complex social processes. In these formative years, Schelling (Schelling, 1971) and Sakoda (Sakoda, 1971) revealed how minimal individual preferences can produce starkly segregated or patterned neighborhoods, while the Garbage Can Model (Cohen et al., 1972) captured the unpredictable intersections of agents, problems, solutions, and participation opportunities in organizations. Meanwhile, through computer tournaments of the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (Axelrod &amp; Hamilton, 1981), Axelrod showed that ongoing reciprocal encounters can make cooperation a self-interested strategy. Around the same time, a study illustrated how heterogeneous, boundedly rational agents on evolving networks can sustain perpetual adaptation and out-of-equilibrium dynamics, setting the stage for viewing large-scale patterns as emergent from local interactions (Anderson, 2018).

In the 1990s, researchers built on these foundational concepts by applying ABM more intensively to economic and social phenomena. For example, El Farol Bar problem (Arthur, 1994) highlighted how learning and adaptation among heterogeneous agents may produce oscillatory behavior, whereas Kirman's study of ants (Kirman, 1993) demonstrated that tiny random shifts in decision-making can trigger large-scale herding. Broadening ABM's scope, Epstein and Axtell (Epstein &amp; Axtell, 1996) introduced the model to show how wealth, culture, and disease dynamics emerge from simple local rules. Axelrod (Axelrod, 1997) further explored cultural dissemination, revealing how social interaction fosters both convergence and enduring diversity.

Since the early 2000s, ABM has steadily expanded into large-scale empirical contexts, including macroeconomics and public policy. Axtell (Axtell, 2001) demonstrated how firm-size distributions-specifically, the Zipf distribution-could be replicated from bottom-up processes driven by micro-level agent interactions. In parallel, Bonabeau (Bonabeau, 2002) surveyed ABM's exceptional capacity to capture emergent phenomena, emphasizing how complex global patterns can arise unpredictably from simpler, localized rules. After the financial crisis of 2008, Farmer and Foley (Farmer &amp; Foley, 2009) further highlighted ABM's potential for illuminating financial instabilities and guiding policy interventions, thereby reinforcing the method's predictive and explanatory power in volatile economic environments.
