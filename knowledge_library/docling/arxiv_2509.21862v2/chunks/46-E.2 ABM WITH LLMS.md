## E.2 ABM WITH LLMS

Below, we elaborate on representative efforts that investigate human-like behavior in LLM agents across psychological, social, economic, and financial domains.

One effort in this direction is PsychoBench (Huang et al., 2023), which assesses the psychological portrayal of LLM agents by examining aspects like personality traits and social intelligence, shedding light on the challenges of modeling human-like behavior in LLM-based agents. In the realm of social simulations, generative agents (Park et al., 2023) utilize LLMs to create believable human-like behaviors, including planning, interaction, and reflection, as demonstrated in interactive environments where agents autonomously coordinate social activities like organizing events. In a similar vein, spontaneously emergent behaviors-such as personality differentiation, social norm formation, and collective hallucinations-have been observed through repeated interactions in a simulated community (Takata et al., 2024). OASIS (Yang et al., 2024) extends this concept by enabling large-scale social media simulations with up to one million agents, facilitating the study of complex social phenomena such as information spreading, group polarization, and herd behavior. Sotopia (Zhou et al., 2024) further examines social intelligence by evaluating LLM agents' coordination, collaboration, and strategic reasoning in diverse scenarios, identifying challenges in achieving human-like social behavior. In the economic domain, EconAgent (Li et al., 2024) leverages LLMs to simulate macroeconomic activities by incorporating human-like decision-making processes, such as work and consumption behaviors, and dynamically adapting to market trends through memory mechanisms. This approach enables more realistic economic dynamics compared to traditional rule-based or learning-based models. In the financial domain, StockAgent (Zhang et al., 2024) models investor behaviors influenced by external factors, providing insights into trading dynamics, while AuctionArena (Chen et al., 2023) focuses on strategic decision-making in competitive bidding environments, testing LLMs' ability to manage resources and adapt strategies.

Together, these works provide a foundation for understanding the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in modeling complex human behaviors across diverse environments.
