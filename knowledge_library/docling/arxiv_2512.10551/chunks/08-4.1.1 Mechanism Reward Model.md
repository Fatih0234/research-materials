## 4.1.1 Mechanism Reward Model

Aligning LLMs with mechanism objectives through post-training requires access to pairwise preference samples over different ad-integrated responses given identical inputs ( x, h, a , b ) . However, in the LLM-native advertising setting, we cannot obtain such counterfactual feedback from users under the same conditions. To address this, we construct a reward model based on the predicted click-through rate (pCTR). By estimating users' click probabilities for ads displayed in varying response contexts, it provides feedback signals for the post-training of the LLMs.

pCTR model in LLM-Auction. Distinct from conventional pCTR models, our pCTR model is employed exclusively for offline training of LLMs and does not participate in the online ad allocation process. This design choice allows it to leverage the full output context ( y ) for more accurate estimation. To focus on the properties of the auction mechanism,
