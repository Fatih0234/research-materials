## 4.2 First-Price Payment Rule

Next, we investigate the payment rules for the LLM-native advertising auction setting. In Section 4.1.3, we reveal the property of allocation continuity in our setting, i.e., each advertiser's allocation is a continuous function of their bid. In this section, we demonstrate how this continuity impacts payment rule design and prove that a simple first-price payment rule exhibits favorable incentive properties, making it suitable for industrial-scale applications.

Ideal incentive-compatible (IC) payment rules (e.g., VCG [Vickrey, 1961, Clarke, 1971, Groves, 1973]) often incur prohibitive computational costs. In practice, the industry widely adopts generalized second-price (GSP) and its variants [Edelman et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2021]. Although these payment rules are not fully IC, they admit stable equilibria and are computationally feasible. In the LLM-native advertising setting, the continuity of allocations implies that an infinitesimal change in bid induces an infinitesimal change in allocation distribution. This renders the classical notion of 'second-price' (i.e., the minimum bid to retain the allocation result) degenerate: the minimum bid is exactly the submitted bid. Thus, under the property of the allocation continuity, first-price and second-price payments become equivalent in the limit .

Recall that the payment rule p maps allocation distributions and bid profiles to payments. Here, we concretize the first-price payment rule, where the payment of advertiser i is the product of its bid and its ITCTR:

In practice, the specific payment function can be defined based on different triggering events, such as clicks, impressions, or participation in the auction. For click-through delivery, the payment function for advertiser i is given as follows:

We now analyze the incentive properties of the first-price payment rule under the two standard advertiser behavior models defined in Section 3. We first consider the case where all advertisers are UMs. Based on Theorem 4.3 and Glicksberg's theorem [Glicksberg, 1952], we have the following corollary:

Corollary 4.4. [Equilibrium under UM] In the LLM-native advertising setting with the optimal allocation rule, the first-price payment rule admits a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium under the UM behavior model.

Next, we consider the case where all advertisers are VMs. We prove that truthful reporting of both private value and return-on-Investment (ROI) is an optimal strategy under the first-price payment rule:

Theorem 4.5. [Truthfulness under VM with ROI] In the LLM-native advertising setting with the optimal allocation rule, the first-price payment mechanism is incentive compatible (IC) for VM with ROI constraint τ i , where the optimal bidding strategy is b i = v i /τ i .

Furthermore, according to Eq. (7), individual rationality (IR) is naturally satisfied for UM under the first-price payment rule. For VM, the IR property is also satisfied when τ i ≥ 1 , which is a standard assumption in practice.

In summary, the first-price payment rule is computationally efficient, satisfies IR, admits equilibria under UM behavior model, and achieves IC under ROI-constrained VM behavior model, making it a highly practical choice for industrial deployment in the LLM-native advertising setting.
