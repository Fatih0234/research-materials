## 5.2.1 Dataset

We construct 3k synthetic user profiles containing basic user information and personal interests. For user query generation, we generate five different user queries from each user profile, resulting in a total of 15k user queries. For simplicity, we fix these queries throughout our experiments. The dataset is then split into 12k queries for training and 3k for testing. For the candidate ad set, we curate 100 real-world advertisements from a leading e-commerce platform Taobao , spanning 50 distinct categories. This ensures diversity and better reflects real-world industrial scenarios. The prompt template used for generating user queries is provided in Appendix B.
