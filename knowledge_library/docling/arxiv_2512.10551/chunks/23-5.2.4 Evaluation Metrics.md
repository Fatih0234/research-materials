## 5.2.4 Evaluation Metrics

We evaluate the efficiency of different mechanisms on the test set D test, which contains distinct user queries and sampled bid profiles from those used in the training set. Based on the click feedback from the User-LLM, we compute the average ad revenue and reward per query. The metrics are formally defined as follows:

- Revenue per Query: 1 |D test | ∑ k ∈D test ∑ i ∈ y k ( b k i · c k i ) .

- Reward per Query: 1 |D test | ∑ k ∈D test R ( x k , h k , a k , b k , y k ) .
