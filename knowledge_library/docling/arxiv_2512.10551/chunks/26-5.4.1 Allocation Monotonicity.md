## 5.4.1 Allocation Monotonicity

To verify the monotonicity of the allocation rule in our proposed LLM-Auction, we conduct a bid perturbation experiment on the test set. Specifically, for each sample, we randomly select an ad and manually adjust its bid. Given that the DPO pair threshold δ th in our IRPO algorithm is 10, we set the perturbed bid values to { 1 , 10 , 20 , . . . , 100 } . We use the LLMs trained by LLM-Auction at different training epochs to generate responses and measure the allocation results by counting the User-LLM's clicks on the perturbed ads for each bid. As shown in Figure 4(a), we observe no clear correlation between bids and ad clicks for the pre-trained LLM. As training progresses, the correlation between allocation results and bids in LLM-Auction gradually increases. After 3 epochs, the mechanism satisfies allocation monotonicity, where higher advertiser's bids consistently lead to higher ad clicks. This finding aligns with our theoretical result in Theorem 4.2, which confirms that our proposed LLM-Auction enables monotonic ad allocation in LLMs.
