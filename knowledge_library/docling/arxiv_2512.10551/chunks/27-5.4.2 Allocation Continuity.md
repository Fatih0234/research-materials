## 5.4.2 Allocation Continuity

Another key property in the LLM-native advertising setting is the allocation continuity of the mechanism, which requires that allocation results change smoothly (non-stepwise) with bids, given a fixed auction environment. To validate this property, we select a fixed query from the test set and a fixed candidate ad, then sweep the bid for this ad from 1 to 100 in increments of 1. For each bid, we generate 200 ad-integrated responses using the LLMs trained by LLM-Auction and count the User-LLM's clicks on the fixed perturbed ad. As depicted in Figure 4(b), the resulting allocation curve is continuous, a stark contrast to the typical step-function form of discrete slot auctions. This supports our theoretical analysis in Theorem 4.3 and justifies the use of the first-price payment rule in our mechanism.

Figure 4: Experiment results of mechanism properties. (a) Allocation monotonicity: The allocation monotonicity of LLM-Auction gradually increase during training. (b) Allocation continuity: With a fixed query and perturbed ad, the allocation results change continuously as the bid increases (dashed lines: raw values; solid lines: smoothed trends).
