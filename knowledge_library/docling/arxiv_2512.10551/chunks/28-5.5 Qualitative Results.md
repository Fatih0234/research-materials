## 5.5 Qualitative Results

In addition to quantitative results, we provide a qualitative comparison of the ad-integrated responses generated by the LLM in LLM-Auction before and after training. This comparison intuitively illustrates how the LLM improves allocation efficiency while satisfying desired mechanism properties. Detailed qualitative comparison results are available in Appendix C. The main findings are summarized as follows:

- Allocation Efficiency: LLM-Auction demonstrates (i) enhanced ad matching capability with higher query-ad relevance of exposed ads, and (ii) improved consistency between the inserted ads and the surrounding context, leading to a higher probability of user clicks.
- Mechanism Properties: LLM-Auction significantly improves the model's perception of bids. Ads with higher bids gain greater impression probability and are more prominent in the generated responses.
