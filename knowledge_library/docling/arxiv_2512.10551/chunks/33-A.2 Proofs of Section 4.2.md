## A.2 Proofs of Section 4.2

Corollary 4.4. [Equilibrium under UM] In the LLM-native advertising setting with the optimal allocation rule, the first-price payment rule admits a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium under the UM behavior model.

Proof. We now establish the existence of a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in the bidding game among advertisers.

For each advertiser i , let the pure strategy space be the bid interval

for some finite upper bound ¯ b &gt; 0 . Obviously, each B i is a nonempty, compact, and convex subset of R , and hence a compact metric space under the standard Euclidean metric.

According to Definition 3.3, the utility of advertiser i under the optimal allocation rule π θ ∗ is given by

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

By the continuity of the optimal allocation rule with respect to the bid profile b in Theorem 4.3, we can obtain that the ITCTR for the ad of the advertiser i , itctr i ( π θ ( · | x, h, a , ( b i , b -i )) ) is continuous on the joint pure strategy space B = ∏ n j =1 B j . Since ( v i -b i ) is also continuous in b i , it follows that u i : B → R is continuous on B .

Thus, the game satisfies the conditions of Glicksberg's theorem Glicksberg [1952]: (i) each pure strategy space B i is a nonempty compact metric space, and (ii) each utility function u i is continuous on the product space B .

Consequently, there exists at least one mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium and completes the proof.

Theorem 4.5. [Truthfulness under VM with ROI] In the LLM-native advertising setting with the optimal allocation rule, the first-price payment mechanism is incentive compatible (IC) for VM with ROI constraint τ i , where the optimal bidding strategy is b i = v i /τ i .

Proof. We first establish that when all advertisers have ROI constraint parameter τ i = 1 , the mechanism is incentive compatible for value maximizers. We then extend this to general τ i ≥ 1 via a reduction. For ease of notation, in the following we use π θ ( b i ) to represent π θ ( · | x, h, a , ( b i , b -i )) when other parameters ( x, h, a , b -i ) are fixed.

The mechanism selects optimal allocation rule π θ ∗ ( b i ) which maximizes its objective function J ( π θ , b ) defined in Eq. (2), and charges each winning advertiser under first-price payment rule as described in Section 4.2:

Recall Definition 3.4, the utility of value maximzer i will be

First, consider an advertiser i with true value v i and ROI constraint τ i = 1 . We would like to prove that truthful bidding b i = v i is the optimal bidding strategy. We analyze the two possible deviations from truthful bidding:

- Underbidding ( b i &lt; v i ): According to Theorem 4.2, the optimal allocation rule π θ ∗ is monontone, then itctr i ( π θ ∗ ( b i )) is weakly increasing in the reported bid b i . Therefore, reporting b i &lt; v i results in weakly lower itctr i ( π θ ∗ ( b i )) and thus weakly lower utility.
- Overbidding ( b i &gt; v i ): The expected value of the advertiser i remains v i · itctr i ( π θ ∗ ( b i )) , but her expected payment becomes b i · itctr i ( π θ ∗ ( b i )) . Since τ i = 1 , the ROI constraint requires

which is violated whenever itctr i ( π θ ∗ ( b i )) &gt; 0 . Thus, any positive allocation under overbidding yields an infeasible outcome; if itctr i ( π θ ∗ ( b i )) = 0 , the advertiser receives zero utility. In either case, overbidding does not improve utility.

Next, we show that how to extend τ i = 1 to the general case τ i ≥ 1 . Based on the analysis in Wilkens et al. [2017], an advertiser with true type ( v i , τ i ) is equivalent, from the platform's perspective, to a value maximizer with value ˜ v i = v i /τ i and ˜ τ i = 1 . This equivalence allows us to reduce truthfulness under ROI constraints to value truthfulness when all advertisers ˜ τ i = 1 . Under this view, truthful bidding for an ROI-constrained advertiser corresponds to report bid equals to her normalized true value, i.e.,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In summary, for advertisers with τ i ≥ 1 , reporting b i = v i /τ i is a dominant strategy for any advertiser with true type ( v i , τ i ) . Consequently, the mechanism is incentive compatible for ROI-constrained advertisers and the optimal bidding strategy for advertiser i is b i = v i /τ i .

and the ROI constraint τ i is considered as
