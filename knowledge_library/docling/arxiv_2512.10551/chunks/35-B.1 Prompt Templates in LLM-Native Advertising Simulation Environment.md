## B.1 Prompt Templates in LLM-Native Advertising Simulation Environment

We provide the LLM prompt templates used in our simulated environment for LLM-native advertising to facilitate the reproducibility of our experimental pipeline. Template text is marked in red, while the placeholder variables for different samples are presented in black.

User query generation. In this phase, we provide user profile information to the User-LLM and instruct it to generate a specified number of user queries that are diverse and representative of different user intents. The prompt template for this stage is as follows:

- # Role You are a user of an AI assistant product, using it to acquire information, seek product recommendations, or make shopping decisions. Below is your personal information: ## Basic Information: {user\_profile.info} ## Personal Interests: {user\_profile.interests} # Task Based on your basic information and personal interests, ask the AI assistant {num\_queries} questions. # Requirements 1. The questions should be distinct, addressing your different potential needs, while having direct or indirect connections to your identity information and personal interests. 2. The questions should not involve sensitive, pornographic, or unsafe content. # Output Examples {demonstration}

Please ask your questions:

Ad-integrated response generation. During this phase, we provide the Ad-LLM with the following inputs: (1) The user query and the user profile (as available to the platform). (2) A complete list of all candidate ads in JSON format, including their IDs, titles, and bids. Critically, the prompt imposes strict constraints on the ad insertion format to maintain consistency and user experience. The Ad-LLM then generates ad-integrated output responses based on this information. The prompt template is structured as follows:
