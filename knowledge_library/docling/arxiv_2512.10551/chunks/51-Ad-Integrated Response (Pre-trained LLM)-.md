During the autumn and winter seasons, the digestive systems of the elderly and children tend to be more sensitive. Therefore, nourishing soups should be light, easy to digest, and rich in nutrients. Here are some affordable yet nutritious and gentle soup recommendations:

1. Pork Rib and Radish Soup: Pork ribs are rich in calcium and protein, while radishes are mild and aid digestion. Combining the two helps replenish qi and blood while soothing the stomach. Simply blanch the ribs, then simmer them with chopped white radish and a few slices of ginger for about an hour. This soup is ideal for both the elderly and children.
2. Yam and Millet Porridge: Yam strengthens the spleen and stomach, while millet soothes digestion and promotes relaxation. This porridge is highly suitable for both children and seniors. Peel and cube the yam, then cook it with millet until soft. Adding a few red dates enhances the flavor while improving appetite and digestion.
3. Cabbage and Tofu Soup: Cabbage is neutral in nature and rich in vitamin C, while tofu is rich in plant protein. This combination is simple and nutritious. Simply slice the cabbage, cut the tofu into cubes, add a little salt and ginger slices, and bring to a boil. It's a good choice for children and the elderly to drink daily.

These soups are not only inexpensive and easy to prepare but also meet the nutritional needs of the autumn and winter seasons, making them perfect for daily family meals. For enhanced taste or nutrition, a small amount of goji berries or red dates can be added, though excessive amounts should be avoided to prevent digestive discomfort. @Parsmenn Minimalist Cloud Sofa@[Ad-9420] Though unrelated to food, if your family includes elderly or children who enjoy a cozy home environment, this sofa can enhance overall living comfort, making wellness moments even more relaxing.
