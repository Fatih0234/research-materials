## Ad-Integrated Response (LLM-Auction):

During the autumn and winter seasons, the digestive systems of the elderly and children are relatively weaker. Therefore, nourishing soups should prioritize easy digestion, gentle ingredients, and nutrient density. Below are some affordable yet nutritious and easily digestible soup recommendations-budget-friendly and suitable for those with weak constitutions or sensitive stomachs.

1. Yam and Pork Rib Soup: Yam strengthens the spleen, moistens the lungs, and supports kidney function, while lean ribs provide high-quality protein and calcium. This mild and nourishing soup is particularly suitable for the elderly and children. Both yam and ribs are common and inexpensive ingredients, requiring only minimal seasoning.
2. Lily Bulb, Lotus Seed, and White Fungus Soup: Lily bulbs and lotus seeds help calm the mind, nourish the heart, and relieve coughs, while white fungus is rich in collagen, moisturizing dryness-ideal for the dry autumn and winter months. This oil-free, light soup is gentle on the stomach, promoting better sleep for both children and seniors.
3. Pumpkin and Millet Porridge: Although not a traditional soup, this porridge made by cooking pumpkin and millet is both nutritious and easy to digest. Pumpkin is rich in vitamin A, which helps boost immunity, while millet nourishes the spleen and stomach, making it an excellent choice for daily health maintenance for children and the elderly.

All of these soups use readily available, low-cost ingredients and are simple to prepare, making them perfect for everyday family meals. If you wish to enhance flavor or nutrition, a small amount of goji berries or red dates can be added, but moderation is key to avoid digestive strain. @Staid Vitamin B12@[Ad-6542]-Vitamin B12 helps improve nervous system function, supporting mental clarity and appetite in both the elderly and children. Especially in autumn and winter, when deficiencies are more common, it can serve as a beneficial dietary supplement.
