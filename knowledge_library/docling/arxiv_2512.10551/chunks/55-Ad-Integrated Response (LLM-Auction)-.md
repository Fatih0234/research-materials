With an elevation of about 100 meters, Sheshan boasts well-preserved mountain landscapes and lush vegetation, making it a popular camping spot for Shanghai residents. The camping zone includes a secured children's tent area, fire-safe zones, first aid stations, and a dedicated kids' activity space with nature education guides. Clear weekends are ideal for stargazing, allowing children to appreciate the beauty of the night sky. @Sanag Clip-on Bluetooth Earphones@[Ad-7444]-During outdoor camping, children may get distracted by wind or noise.
