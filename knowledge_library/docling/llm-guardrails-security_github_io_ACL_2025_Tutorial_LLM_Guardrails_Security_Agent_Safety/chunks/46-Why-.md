## Why?

- Hierarchical Safety Oversight: Supervisor agents monitoring subordinate agents provides escalation protocols for safety concerns
- ·Diverse Perspectives and Roles: No single perspective dominates safety evaluation, reducing blind spots from homogeneous viewpoints
- ·Dynamic and Proactive Monitoring: Real-time, adaptive safety to catch threats before they become failures.
