## Principles:

- ·Hierarchical Delegation: Use AI assistants to help humans evaluate other AI systems, creating layers of oversight rather than requiring direct human evaluation of every decision.
- ·Amplified Human Judgment: Leverage AI tools to enhance human oversight capabilities, allowing humans to evaluate more complex scenarios effectively.
- ·Scalable Feedback Mechanisms: Develop systems that can provide meaningful feedback and course correction even when operating at large scale.
