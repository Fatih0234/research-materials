## Why Do We Need It?

- Human bottleneck: Direct human evaluation doesn't scale with increasing AI capability and deployment
- Expertise gaps: AI systems may operate in domains where human expertise is limited
- Speed mismatch: AI systems can make decisions faster than humans can evaluate them
- Complexity barrier: AI reasoning may become too complex for direct human comprehension
