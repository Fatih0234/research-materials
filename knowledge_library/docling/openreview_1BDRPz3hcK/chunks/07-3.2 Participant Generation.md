## 3.2 Participant Generation

We construct a synthetic participant pool by augmenting the existing GENAGENTS persona bank (Park et al., 2024). In addition to the demographic and social attributes present in GENAGENTS (including age, education, ethnicity, gender, income, political ideology, geographic region), we augment them with independently sampled values for the Big Five personality dimensions-openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism-drawn at random (DeYoung et al., 2007). We include these five personality dimensions because psychological research demonstrates their robust associations with interpersonal trust (Sharan &amp; Romano, 2020; Bartosik et al., 2021; Evans &amp; Revelle, 2008). The purpose of the augmentation is to increase the variability of attribute-behavior effect sizes in the Trust Game. We represent each persona as an attribute vector, pi = ( t ( i ) 1 , t ( i ) 2 , . . . , t ( i ) K ) , where t ( i ) k denotes the value of the k -th attribute for persona i . Attributes are a mix of categorical and ordinal types. All experimental results in this paper use our test split of the GENAGENTS persona bank; the training and validation splits were used only for prompt template design and pipeline tuning. Appendix A provides a complete list of attribute types and details of the dataset splits.
