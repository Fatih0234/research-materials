## 3.3 Organization of Experiments

Our experimental study proceeds in two parts. First, Section 4 considers: (a) the evaluation of population-level belief-behavior consistency, assessing whether statistical patterns in simulated behavior align with elicited beliefs; and (b) whether consistency improves when LLMs are self-conditioned (receiving their own elicited beliefs as additional context in the role-playing prompt), or deteriorates under the use of imposed priors (when agents are given modified priors that systematically diverge from their original beliefs to test controllability). Second, Section 5 presents an assessment of individual-level belief-behavior consistency, comparing an agent's forecasted and enacted actions across multiple rounds of the Trust Game against fixed Trustee archetypes. Together, these analyses offer a multi-scale view of belief-behavior consistency in LLM-based simulations.
