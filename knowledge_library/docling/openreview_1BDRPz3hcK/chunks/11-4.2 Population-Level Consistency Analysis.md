## 4.2 Population-Level Consistency Analysis

Table 3 reports the median Spearman correlation and median absolute effect size difference for each LLM and elicitation strategy. Using the median for both metrics reduces sensitivity to outlier attributes.

Providing task-specific context during belief elicitation does not enhance belief-behavior consistency. We compare two belief elicitation strategies that differ only in the presence of explicit Trust Game instructions when asking the model to predict how persona attributes influence transfer amounts: one strategy provides full game rules and the agent's role,

Table 3: Population-Level Self-Consistency Analysis: Effect Size Difference ( | ∆ η 2 | ) and Spearman Correlation ( ρ ) Across Models and Strategies. Lower | ∆ η 2 | indicates better portability (smaller effect size differences). Higher ρ indicates better correlation preservation across contexts.

while the other omits all task-specific context (see Appendix C.1.2 and Appendix C.1.1 respectively for prompt templates). Across all LLMs and attributes, supplying Trust Game context during belief elicitation failed to increase Spearman rank correlation or reduce the absolute effect-size discrepancy compared to context-free elicitation. These findings contradict prior evidence that contextual prompts reliably shift LLM outputs away from pretraining biases (Tao et al., 2024), indicating that providing additional context alone does not improve the agreement between elicited attribute-behavior beliefs and the agent's simulated transfer decisions.

Elicitation target affects different aspects of belief-behavior consistency. We compare belief elicitation strategies that target different constructs: behavioral outcomes directly (CTX+$, asking for dollar amounts sent) versus latent psychological constructs (CTX+TR, NOCTX+TR, asking about interpersonal trust levels). These strategies exhibit complementary strengths across our two consistency metrics. For rank ordering consistency (Spearman correlation), the behavioral outcome strategy (CTX+$) yields more accurate attribute rankings than construct-focused strategies, as it directly mirrors the simulation task. However, for effect size consistency , construct-focused strategies (CTX+TR, NOCTX+TR) produce estimates more closely aligned with behavioral values, while the behavioral outcome strategy (CTX+$) systematically overestimates effect magnitudes. This suggests that LLMs encode attribute-behavior relationships differently when queried about psychological abstractions versus concrete behavioral predictions.
