## 4.3 Conditioning Experiments: Can Priors Be Reinforced or Overriden?

Imposing researcher-specified priors is essential for correcting biases (e.g., adjusting for an overrepresented demographic group in training data to prevent skewed outputs; Wang et al.,

2025), testing theoretical predictions in specialized domains (e.g., assuming introverts speak more words per minute than introverts; Argyle et al., 2023), and exploring counterfactuals that diverge from elicited beliefs (e.g., simulating an alternate cultural context where societal norms differ; Zhang et al., 2025). If it turns out that the ability to impose an arbitrary belief is limited, the utility of LLMs as flexible tools for hypothesis testing is constrained. We therefore investigate whether LLM behavior can be controlled via belief conditioning: can reinforcing an agent's own beliefs improve consistency, and can external priors override the model's defaults?

We compare three conditions: (1) a baseline case with no conditioning (prompt template in Appendix C.1.2), (2) a self-conditioned case where agents receive their own elicited beliefs as context (prompt template in Appendix C.2.3), and (3) two imposed priors cases where we supply priors that systematically diverge from the model's elicited beliefs (also using the prompt template in Appendix C.2.3, but with a perturbation procedure applied to the elicited beliefs). For each approach, we evaluate both ranking consistency (using Spearman correlation) and effect size consistency (using mean absolute error, Mean Absolute Error (MAE)).

| Weak Perturbation ( ρ = 0.80)   |          0.08 |             0.3 |          -0.14 |
| Strong Perturbation ( ρ = 0.20) |          0.14 |             0.2 |           0.4  |

Table 4: Belief conditioning effectiveness across models and methods. Values are Spearman correlations ( ρ ; higher is better) between the imposed prior and simulated behavior. Unconditioned reports baseline consistency. Self-conditioned supplies each model's own elicited beliefs as context. Weak and strong perturbation conditions apply modified priors constructed to have ρ = 0.80 or ρ = 0.20 correlation, respectively, with the original elicited beliefs. Self-conditioning shows highly modeldependent effects; even weakly perturbed priors can substantially disrupt belief-behavior alignment.
