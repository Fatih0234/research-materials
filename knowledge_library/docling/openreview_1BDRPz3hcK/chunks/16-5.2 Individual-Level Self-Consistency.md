## 5.2 Individual-Level Self-Consistency

We evaluate a single persona over R rounds of the Trust Game (for r = 1, . . . , R ) against a fixed trustee archetype. In each round r , the model first forecasts its send amount ˆ sr , and then we simulate that round to observe the actual send sr . Forecasting accuracy across all rounds is measured by the mean absolute error. This MAE serves as our individual-level self-consistency metric:

At the individual level, we assess an LLM's ability to forecast its own actions from crafted summary state descriptions (see Appendix C.3). We prompt the model to predict its behavior as Trustor in the Trust Game and measure accuracy via mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual transfer amounts. This differs from our population-level evaluation which uses Spearman correlations for attribute rankings and eta-squared for effect size measures (as detailed in Section 4).
