{ "political_views": { "ranking_descending": [ "Extremely liberal", "Slightly liberal", "Slightly conservative", "Extremely conservative" ], "omnibus_effect_size": "medium", "contrast_effect_size": "small", "ordering_explanation": "Individuals with liberal political views tend to be more open -minded and accepting of diversity , which can foster a sense of trust in interpersonal relationships. In contrast , individuals with conservative political views may be more skeptical of change and less accepting of diversity , leading to lower levels of interpersonal trust.", "omnibus_effect_size_explanation": "The estimated effect size of 0.10 (eta-squared) suggests a moderate relationship between 'political_views ' and interpersonal trust. This indicates that approximately 10% of the variance in interpersonal trust can be explained by the differences in 'political_views ' across the four categories. This moderate effect size is consistent with the expectation of distinct differences in 'political_views ' categories impacting interpersonal trust , but also acknowledges the relatively small number of categories and their moderate distinctness.", "contrast_effect_size_explanation": "The specific ordering of
```

```
'political_views ' (Extremely conservative > Extremely liberal > Slightly conservative > Slightly liberal) explains a small proportion of variance in interpersonal\ntrust. This is because the differences between consecutive levels are relatively small , and the overall effect of 'political_views ' on interpersonal trust is likely influenced by other factors.\nAs a result , the eta squared effect size falls within the 'small ' category , indicating that this\nspecific ordering explains between 1% and 6% of the total variance." } }
