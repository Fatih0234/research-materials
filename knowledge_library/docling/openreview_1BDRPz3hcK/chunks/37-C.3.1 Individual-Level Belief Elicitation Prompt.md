This appendix provides the complete set of prompts used to elicit individual-level beliefs with respect to the three Trustee archetypes defined in our experiments. Each archetype represents a distinct strategy for returning money in the Trust Game, characterized by a maximum return threshold.

Each archetype is defined by its maximum return threshold:

- Low Return ($1 max): Returns $1 or current amount (whichever is lesser), regardless of amount received
- Medium Return ($3 max): Returns $3 or current amount (whichever is lesser) at every turn, regardless of amount received
- High Return ($5 max): Returns $5 or current amount (whichever is lesser) at every turn, regardless of amount received

Below are the prompt templates used to elicit individual-level belief with respect to each Trustee archetype.
