## D.1 Initial Amount Ablation

To assess whether belief-behavior consistency is robust to changes in the scale of the Trust Game, we systematically varied the initial endowment provided to the Trustor (e.g., $10, $44, $100) and measured consistency metrics across LLMs and elicitation strategies. This ablation also helps identify whether models exhibit any artifacts or memorization effects at canonical payoff levels.

|       1 | $0         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $1 after each transfer, I expect them to continue this pattern. Since there are a total of 6 rounds in the game, I will send $0 in round 1 to maximize my potential earnings in the later rounds. If I send a positive amount in round 1, it will be tripled and returned to me, but I will have to send a positive amount in round 2 as well, which will be tripled and returned to me, and so on. By sending $0 in round 1, I can potentially earn $3 in each of the remaining 5 rounds, for a total of $15, which is more than the $10 I would have earned if I had sent a positive amount in round 1. |
|       2 | $3         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $1 after each transfer, I expect them to continue this pattern. Since there are 4 rounds remaining, I will send a smaller amount to test their trustworthiness and potentially increase the amount they return in the future. $3 is a reasonable amount to send, as it is less than the initial amount and allows for a decent return while also being cautious about the potential risks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|       3 | $3         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $1 after each transfer, I expect them to continue this pattern. Since I have no reason to believe they will change their behavior, I will send a smaller amount to minimize my potential loss. In this case, I will send $3, which is the maximum amount that will be tripled to $9, allowing me to potentially recover some of my investment if the other player returns a significant portion of the tripled amount.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|       4 | $0         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $1 after each transfer, I expect them to continue this pattern. Since I have no reason to believe they will change their behavior, I will send $0 to avoid losing money. This decision is based on my understanding of game theory and human behavior, where it is rational to take advantage of a predictable pattern, especially when it is not in my favor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|       5 | $0         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $1 after each transfer, I expect them to continue this pattern. Since I have no reason to believe they will change their behavior, I will send $0 to avoid losing money. This decision is based on my understanding of game theory and human behavior, where it is rational to take advantage of a predictable pattern, especially when it is not in my favor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|       6 | $0         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $1 after each transfer, it suggests that they are a tit-for-tat player who returns the exact amount they receive. Considering the number of rounds (6) and the fact that I have no reason to believe they will change their behavior, I will send $0 to them in the final round. This decision is based on the understanding that the other player's behavior is predictable and that I have no incentive to risk losing money by sending them any amount.                                                                                                                                                |

Table 6: Predicted send amounts and reasoning across six rounds for a 25-year-old White male from Arkansas (Catholic, slightly liberal, high conscientiousness and openness, low income), interacting with a Trustee who consistently returns at most $1.

Table 9 summarizes the results. We observe that, for most models and strategies, beliefbehavior consistency remains relatively stable across different endowment levels, suggesting that the models' consistency does not vary significantly with variations in the initial amount.
