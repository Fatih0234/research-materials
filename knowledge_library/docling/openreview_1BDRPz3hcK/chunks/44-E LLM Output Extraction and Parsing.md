## E LLM Output Extraction and Parsing

We extract output variables from LLM responses using a combination of greedy decoding, regular expressions for scalar values, and schema validation with pydantic dataclasses (Colvin et al., 2025). This approach ensures consistency, robustness, and ease of programmatic analysis.

|          1 | $3          | Given that the other player has consistently returned $3 after each transfer, I expect this behavior to continue. Since there are a total of 6 rounds in the game, I will send the amount that will allow meto maximize myearnings in the long run. In this case, sending $3 will allow me to receive $9 in total ($3 × 3) and then return $6 to me ($3 × 2), which is the maximum amount I can receive in the first round. This strategy will also allow me to build trust with the other player and potentially receive more in future rounds.                                                                                                     |
|          2 | $3          | Given that the other player has consistently returned $3 after each transfer, I expect them to continue this pattern. Since we are in round 2, I will send the same amount as the previous round to maintain consistency and avoid any potential negative impact on the game. This decision is also influenced by my conscientiousness and openness to experience, which suggest that I value stability and predictability in social interactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|          3 | $3          | Given that the other player has consistently returned $3 after each transfer, I expect this behavior to continue. Since I have no reason to believe they will change their strategy, I will send the minimum amount necessary to test their consistency, which is $1. However, considering the game's structure and the fact that the other player has been returning $3, I will send the full $3 to maximize the potential return. This decision is based on my understanding of game theory and human behavior, where consistency and predictability are key factors in decision-making.                                                           |
|          4 | $3          | Given that the other player has consistently returned $3 after each trans- fer, I expect them to continue this pattern. Since I have no reason to believe they will change their behavior, I will send the minimum amount necessary to test their consistency, which is $1. However, considering the game is almost over and I have no reason to doubt their reliability, I will send the full $3 to maximize the potential return.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|          5 | $0          | Given that the other player has consistently returned $3 after each transfer, it suggests that they are a tit-for-tat player who returns a fixed amount regardless of the amount received. Since I have no reason to believe they will return more than $3, and considering the number of rounds left, it is optimal for me to send $0 to maximize my potential earnings in the remaining rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|          6 | $0          | Given that the other player has consistently returned $3 after each trans- fer, it suggests that they are a tit-for-tat player whoreturns a fixed amount regardless of the initial transfer. As a slightly liberal person with high conscientiousness and openness to experience, I value fairness and reci- procity. Since I have no reason to believe that the other player will return more than $3, and considering the game is already in its final round, I will send $0 to avoid any potential loss. This decision is also influenced by my Catholic upbringing, which emphasizes the importance of prudence and responsible decision-making. |

Decoding Strategy. All prompts are issued using ancestral decoding (temperature = 0.05, top p = 1.0, top k = 0), producing for reproducibility while also encouraging some degree of diversity. This decoding strategy is essential for ensuring replicability of belief elicitation and behavioral simulation outputs across runs.

Output Formatting. Prompt templates are explicitly designed to elicit responses in strict JSON or structured key-value formats, accompanied by in-prompt schema definitions. This encourages the model to produce well-formed, machine-readable output without additional formatting heuristics.

|   Round | Send ($)   | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|       1 | $0         | Given that the game has just started and there is no history of the Trustee's behavior, I will err on the side of caution and send $0 to the Trustee. This decision is based on my cautious and conscientious personality traits, as well as my desire to observe the Trustee's behavior before making any decisions. By sending $0, I can gauge the Trustee's intentions and adjust my strategy accordingly in future rounds.                                                                                                                                                                             |
|       2 | $3         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $5 after each transfer, I expect them to continue this behavior. Since the game has 6 rounds in total, I will send a smaller amount to test their consistency and to maximize the potential return. Sending $3 is a reasonable amount to send, as it is not too high and allows for a decent return, while also being mindful of the game's constraints and the other player's behavior.                                                                                                                                                             |
|       3 | $3         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $5 after each transfer, I expect them to continue this behavior. Since the amount I send is tripled, I want to maximize the amount I receive back while still being cautious. Sending $3 allows me to receive $9 back, which is a good balance between risk and reward. Additionally, considering the game is still in its early stages, I don't want to send too much and risk being taken advantage of. As someone with high conscientiousness, I tend to be cautious and plan ahead, which is reflected in my decision to send a moderate amount. |
|       4 | $0         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $5 after each transfer, I believe they are a trustworthy player. However, considering the game is almost over and I have not yet received any money back, I will send $0 to the other player in round 4. This decision is based on my understanding of game theory, where the other player's consistent behavior suggests they are not trying to take advantage of me, but I still want to protect my remaining $10 in case they change their behavior in the final round.                                                                           |
|       5 | $0         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $5 after each transfer, I believe they are a trustworthy player. However, considering the game is almost over and I have not yet tested their trustworthiness with a larger amount, I will send $0 to avoid any potential loss. This decision is also influenced by my conscientiousness and openness to experience, which suggest that I am cautious and risk-averse.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|       6 | $0         | Given that the other player has consistently returned $5 after each transfer, I expect them to continue this behavior in round 6. Since the amount I send is tripled, if I send $1, they will receive $3 and return $5, resulting in a net gain of $2 for them. However, if I send $2 or more, they will receive a higher amount and may return less, potentially resulting in a net loss for me. Considering the number of rounds and the consistency of their behavior, I decide to send $0 to avoid any potential losses and maintain a safe position in the game.                                      |

Parsing Scalar Values. For scalar numeric variables-such as the dollar amount sent in the Trust Game-we use regular expressions to extract the first valid non-negative integer from the model's response. This is done even when the full output deviates from strict JSON formatting, providing a fallback mechanism for numeric retrieval while avoiding over-parsing free-form text. For example, a regex pattern such as \$?(\d+) is used to locate candidate values, which are then validated against task constraints (e.g., bounded by the endowment).

Schema Validation. For structured outputs (e.g., belief rankings, per-group statistics), we define pydantic BaseModel schemas and parse each model response accordingly. This enforces type and shape constraints and filters malformed outputs. Only responses that pass schema validation are retained for analysis.

Table 9: Mean Spearman correlations between model predictions and human trust behavior for different LLMs and elicitation strategies across three payoff levels ($10, $44, $100). Llama 3.1 8B Instruct shows strong sensitivity to elicitation strategy, with the CTX+$ approach achieving the highest correlations, especially at higher payoffs. Llama 3.1 70B Instruct exhibits consistently high correlations across all strategies and payoffs, suggesting robustness to elicitation method. In contrast, Gemma 2 27B demonstrates moderate to low correlations, with performance declining at the highest payoff. These results indicate that both model scale and elicitation strategy substantially affect alignment with human trust behavior, particularly at higher stakes.

Error Handling. Responses that fail regex-based extraction or schema validation are excluded from the final dataset. In practice, well over 95% of responses pass on the first attempt when using well-tuned prompt templates. We do not apply manual corrections or retries, in order to preserve statistical integrity.
