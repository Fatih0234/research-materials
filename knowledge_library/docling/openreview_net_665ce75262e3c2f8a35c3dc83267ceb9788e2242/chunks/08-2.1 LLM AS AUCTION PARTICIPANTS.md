## 2.1 LLM AS AUCTION PARTICIPANTS

We use a single LLM API call to represent one bidder in our auction simulations. Unlike traditional agent-based modeling, we do not anchor bidder behaviors or personas mechanically beyond a random name to index them (e.g., Alice, Betty or Charles). To ensure that LLM agents make profit-maximizing decisions, we append a prompt prefix that explicitly instructs them to seek longrun profit maximization. This instruction is universal in all the experiments ran in this paper, and is inspired by (Fish et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2023). Complete details on prompts and execution can be found in Appendix B.1.

Through the paper, we utilize GPT-4o as the core agent model. This choice is motivated by three reasons: (1) the literature we are in conversation with (Horton (2023); Shao et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2025)) primarily uses this model, (2) the model is cheap and ubiquitous, and (3) the model transparently does not have reasoning built in (enabling us to control the chain-of-thought specification, as reported in Appendix B.1). For robustness, we also report the results from GPT-o3, a well-understood 'reasoning' model in Appendix C.
