## 2.2 SIMULATION PROCEDURE

For each auction experiment, we simulate n (often 3) LLM agents bidding against one another. Each setting is repeated multiple times, with randomized private values drawn for each round. We design our multi-round protocol to mirror standard laboratory experiments in the auction literature. Full prompt texts are in Appendix I, and an example round is detailed in Appendix B.1. API calls are made using the Python package Expected Parrot Domain-Specific Language (EDSL), a wrapper that structures LLM queries and responses in the desired format (Horton et al., 2024). For every auction, we use GPT-4o at a temperature of 0 . 5 . 2
