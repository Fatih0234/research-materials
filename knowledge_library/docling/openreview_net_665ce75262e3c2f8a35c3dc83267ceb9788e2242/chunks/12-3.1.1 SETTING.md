## 3.1.1 SETTING

There are three bidders in each auction, and each bidder i 's value is drawn from an independent, uniform distribution v i ∼ U [0 , 99] . Bidders, upon observing their value, submit a sealed bid β ( v ) , with β ( · ) a vector mapping each component value to its corresponding bid, corresponding to a strategy profile for reporting based on the valuation profile. In the FPSB auction, the highest bidder pays her bid and receives the prize (and all other bidders pay 0 and receive no prize). In the SPSB auction, the highest bidder pays the second-highest bid and receives the prize (and all other bidders pay 0 and receive no prize). Bids are submitted in $1 increments and ties are resolved randomly.
