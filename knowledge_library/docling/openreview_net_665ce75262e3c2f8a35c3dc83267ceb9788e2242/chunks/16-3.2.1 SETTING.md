## 3.2.1 SETTING

There are three bidders in each auction but now, following Li (2017), bidders draw affiliated private values (APV) of the form v i = c + p i . The common component c is drawn once, c ∼ U [0 , 20] , and the private component p i is drawn n times independently, p i ∼ U [0 , 20] . Winners of the auction receive their own value of the prize v i when they win, and the 'common' and 'private' components serve to make values correlated. We switch to considering APV settings in this section for two reasons. First, in spirit of our larger goal to provide many benchmarks of LLM play in various environments. Second, to enable comparison with the existing empirical literature; the two largest experiments of which have been conducted in APV settings.

The ascending clock auction (AC) has a global price clock that increases in some fixed increment and bidders who choose when to drop out. The last bidder remaining wins the prize at the price where the second to last bidder dropped out. If multiple bidders are the last to drop out, we resolve ties by randomly allocating the prize among them and setting the winning price to that mutual drop out price. We also study the blind ascending clock auction (AC-B), a variant where bidders are not told when other bidders drop out.
