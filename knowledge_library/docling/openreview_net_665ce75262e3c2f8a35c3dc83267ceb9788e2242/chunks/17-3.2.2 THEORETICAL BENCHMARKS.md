## 3.2.2 THEORETICAL BENCHMARKS

What effect an affiliated values environment has on strategic behavior may not be ex-ante obvious. On one hand, the correlation in values may strengthen incentives for extremal-valued bidders, so that extremal-valued bidders are actually more likely to bid their value even in the sealed-bid format (echoing arguments from Li (2017)). On the other hand, APV may be cognitively more complex for bidders relative to IPV environments, thereby inducing errors in play. In either case, the three auction formats in this section are strategically equivalent, and so the affiliation is, in the rational sense, a red herring: for all three auctions it is still a dominant strategy to bid (or drop out at) one's value. The SPSB, AC-B and AC auctions share an equilibrium in dominant strategies:

An agent's bid in the AC format is equivalent to the price at which they drop out of the auction at. We will use the terms 'bid' and 'drop-out price' interchangeably in the context of clock auctions.
