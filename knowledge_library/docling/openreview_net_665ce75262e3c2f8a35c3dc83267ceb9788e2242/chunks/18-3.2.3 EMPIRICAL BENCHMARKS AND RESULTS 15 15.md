## 3.2.3 EMPIRICAL BENCHMARKS AND RESULTS 15 15

For each of the APV auction formats, we perform 5 experiments with 15 rounds and 3 LLM bidders competing over a prize. A single round for the clock format is the run of a global clock from the initial price of $0 to the final clearing price. Complete detail for the simulation procedure of a single clock round is provided in B.2.

Our main results are plotted in Figure 2. We find that the clock formats induce play significantly closer to one's value than the sealed-bid format. Table 1 summarizes this concisely: the clock formats, aggregated, have an average difference between bid and value of 1 . 83 (with 73 . 9% of agents dropping out at their value, excluding winners), while the SPSB bidding has an average difference between bid and value of 6 . 26 (with 18 . 7% of all bids equal to an agent's value) 5 . This corresponds closely with Li (2017)'s experimental results: aggregated across all rounds, he reports a mean difference between bid and value of 2 . 48 for the ascending clock auction, and a mean difference of 6 . 52 for the sealed-bid auction. In general, the clock format improves play for LLM bidders in much the same way as with human bidders.

Figure 2: Comparison of three strategically equivalent auctions (the AC, AC-B and SPSB auctions) in an APV setting. The AC and AC-B auctions are obviously strategy-proof, whereas the SPSB auction is only strategy-proof. The black dot-dash line represents the dominant strategy of value-bidding. In the clock auctions, red triangles indicate non-winners' drop out prices and blue circles indicate the final price that winners win at. In the SPSB auction, red triangles indicate nonwinners' bids and the winning bid in clock auctions.

Table 1: Share of truthful bidding in the AC, AC-B and SPSB auctions in an APV setting.

| Metric               | AC          | AC-B        | SPSB        |
|----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Truthful Bidding (%) | 70.0%       | 76.7%       | 18.7%       |
| Average Difference   | 2.03 (0.39) | 1.63 (0.40) | 6.26 (0.62) |
| Sample size          | 90          | 90          | 150         |

Breitmoser and Schweighofer-Kodritsch (2022) provide additional evidence that clock auctions improve truthful play, and also provide evidence that play under AC is slightly better than under AC-B. While we replicate the former result, we fail to replicate the latter result. Play under the AC auction was not significantly different compared to the AC-B auction ( t = 0 . 71 , p = 0 . 48 ) in our experiments. We report all the two-sample t-tests of the mean absolute difference between bids and values in Table 3 - both AC and AC-B mechanisms show significantly smaller bid-value deviations than the SPSB auction (p &lt; 0.001), but not from one another.

Finally, we observe that the clock format improves on a particular failure mode of the SPSB - namely, bidding above one's value. The result is that the lion's share of total mistakes in clock auctions come

5 Following the definition in Li (2017), we define truthful bidding in the ascending clock (AC) and ascending clock with bid (AC-B) auctions as dropping out within one increment of the bidder's true value (excluding winners), and in the second-price sealed-bid (SPSB) auction as submitting a bid exactly equal to one's true value.

from dropping out too early rather than too late. Although OSP mechanisms cannot rationalize a difference between over- and under-bidding (both represent deviations from an obviously dominant strategy), this evidence further suggests that over- and under-bidding represent categorically distinct failure modes. Further exploration into rationalizations of the difference between these two failure modes remains an interesting and open question for future research.
