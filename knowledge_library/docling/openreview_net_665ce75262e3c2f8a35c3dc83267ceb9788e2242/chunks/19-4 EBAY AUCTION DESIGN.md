## 4 EBAY AUCTION DESIGN

Having tested LLMs against classic results in auction theory, we now build an auction environment to test components of auction design in a setting inspired by eBay's online marketplace. eBay's auction platform, studied by Einav et al. (2011) and others, features various design elements - for example, a hidden reserve price (as opposed to a reserve price) and proxy bidding - that are in theory less critical to auction outcomes yet in practice appear to have substantial effects on bidder behavior. These differences highlight the gap between textbook theory and real-world bidding, where seemingly small design details can alter bidder behavior and thus price discovery and revenue.

One dramatic departure from simple, truthful bidding observed in practice is 'bid sniping,' or the practice of placing bids in the final moments of an auction to avoid triggering competitive responses. Sniping is prevalent on eBay, with dedicated e-snipe services automating last-second bid submissions. 6 One proposed avenue to curb sniping is the 'closing rule' (also called a 'soft-close' or 'auction extension' rule) - namely, when a new maximum bid comes in at the last minute, extend the auction close to allow for more bidding. This design detail has been credited with the substantial difference in bidding dynamics between earlier auctions on Amazon.com, which had this auctionextension rule, and auctions on eBay, which do not. Empirically, Roth and Ockenfels (2002) and Ockenfels and Roth (2006) show that much less sniping occurred on Amazon.com (with a closing rule) compared to eBay (with no closing rule).

In this section, we simulate a stylized version of the eBay auction design to consider two design parameters more closely: the hidden reserve price and the implementation of such a closing rule.
