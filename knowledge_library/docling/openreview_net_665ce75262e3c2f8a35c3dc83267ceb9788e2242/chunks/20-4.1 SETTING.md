## 4.1 SETTING

In each eBay simulation, there are three bidders. Without the modified closing rule, the auction runs for 10 bidding periods. Bidders draw private values uniformly and independently from [0 , 99] . The item to be bid in standard auctions is specified as a 'prize'. In eBay auctions, we arbitrarily set the prize item as a '256GB IPhone 16 pro' and the item condition is set to be 'used' for realism. In regard to the auction environment, we consider four treatments, varying the hidden reserve and the closing rule: (T1:) a standard eBay auction with proxy bidding; (T2:) an eBay auction with a modified (auction extension) closing rule; (T3:) a standard eBay auction with a hidden reserve price; and (T4:) an eBay auction with both a modified (auction extension) closing rule and a hidden reserve price.

For each hidden reserve price design, we run experiments with hidden reserves at r = 40 , 50 , and 60 . With this stylized eBay framework we abstract away from additional eBay design features such as shipping fees and Buy-It-Now.
