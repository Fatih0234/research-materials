## 4.2 SIMULATION PROCESS OF EBAY AUCTION

For eBay auctions, we discretize the continuous bidding period into 10 periods. Each period, LLM agents decide whether to increase their bid or hold their current bid. The bidding process follows a structured format, where bidders act in a predefined sequence each period (e.g., Charles, then Alice, then Betty). In particular, agents are informed of past price changes through a transcript, such as 'On day 1, the price changed to 1. On day 2, the price changed to 3.' The complete simulation process is reported in Appendix B.3 and prompts are listed in Appendix I.
