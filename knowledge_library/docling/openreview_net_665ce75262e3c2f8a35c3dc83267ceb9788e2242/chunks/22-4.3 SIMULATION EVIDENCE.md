## 4.3 SIMULATION EVIDENCE

Hidden reserve price results. Figure 10 shows that the auction revenue remains basically unchanged regardless of the experiment type. In Appendix Table 4 , we report a table of two-sided t-tests making this explicit.

Closing rule results. Second, we demonstrate that modifying eBay's closing rule to allow for an extension of the auction when there is final-period bidding has a major effect on bidder behavior. We define the final-winning-bid time as the last period in which the eventual winner changes her maximum bid. If she raises her maximum in a later period, that later period becomes the recorded time. This is a measure for when the bidder who would win the auction was determined.

Figure 3 reports a CDF across the four treatment types (T1 - T4). Without the modified closing rule, we see that LLMs predominantly bid in the period before close; however, with the modified closing rule, this behavior disappears. In effect, the modified closing rule shifts the winning bid time earlier in clock time, so that the auction's winner is chosen earlier (thereby improving auction efficiency). For further visualization of this dynamic, Figure 9 in the Appendix reports the 'final winning bid time' as a histogram across auction instances with and without the modified closing rule.
