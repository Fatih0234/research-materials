## 5 INTERVENTION DESIGN IN SEALED-BID AUCTION

It matters how agents perceive mechanisms. Here, we present six interventions which affect the perception of the SPSB auction without affecting underlying theoretical optimality (given the SPSB's equilibrium in dominant strategies). Of the six interventions, the first three seek to prime agents on particular conceptual frameworks, the next two provide (good and bad) advice, and the last is a behavioral intervention.

The detailed intervention designs are: Menu-Description (menu intervention) , which provides the extensive form of the auction as a menu to the agent (inspired by Gonczarowski et al. (2023)); Clock-Description (proxy intervention) , which describes the ascending-clock process-though the proxy clock is introduced before the game begins, the auction itself is still operated as an SPSB auction (inspired by Breitmoser and Schweighofer-Kodritsch (2022)); Nash-Deviation (nash intervention) , which illustrates a Nash-style thought process by asking what happens if one bids up or down; Direct Revelation (dominant strat intervention) , which directly reveals the dominant strategy of bidding one's value; Wrong Direct Revelation (wrong strat intervention) , an ablation study that incorrectly instructs the agent to bid half of its value; and Risk-neutrality prompting (risk intervention) , which defines risk-neutrality in terms of gambles and explicitly prompts the LLM to act in a more risk-neutral manner. The full intervention prompts are provided in Appendix J and are appended to the end of the rule explanation prompt when eliciting LLM bids.
