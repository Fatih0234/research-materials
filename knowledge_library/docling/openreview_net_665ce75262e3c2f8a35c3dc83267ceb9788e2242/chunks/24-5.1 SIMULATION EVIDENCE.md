## 5.1 SIMULATION EVIDENCE

The results of the six interventions are reported below. To characterize the error from the theoretical prediction at bid = value , we also report the R 2 against β ∗∗ ( v ) = v in Table 2. However, as was clear in the discussion of the empirical literature in Section 3.1, overbidding and underbidding constitute different failure modes - in particular, many human bidders suffer the failure mode of overbidding in the SPSB auction.

Table 2: Intervention Type Analysis by Category, SPSB and IPV environment. The table compares how each intervention changes bidding performance relative to the dominant-strategy benchmark β ∗∗ ( v ) = v . Larger R 2 means a tighter overall fit, while 'SS Above/Below' and 'Prop Above/Below' decompose the error into classic over- versus under-bidding. Priming agents to consider the logic of Nash deviations via prompt cuts both types of error (raising R 2 from 0.48 to 0.84), but the direct-advice treatment is even stronger, pushing R 2 above 0.95 and halving the under-bidding sum-of-squares. In contrast, misleading advice ('Wrong Strategy') produces the worst outcomes, yielding a negative R 2 and almost universal under-bidding. Finally, the risk-neutrality prime largely eliminates over-bidding yet leaves systematic caution below the 45° line.

As such, we also decompose the R 2 into the sum of squares above and below β ∗∗ ( v ) = v to report each intervention's performance in terms of the two components of overbidding and underbidding. We report each of these interventions alongside the results from the original SPSB experiments of Section 3.1 (No Intervention) in Table 2.

Unsurprisingly, the 'advice' intervention which reports the true dominant strategy improves play the most, with an R 2 = . 95 . However, interestingly, the second most effectively intervention is the Nash intervention. It makes significant improvements relative to base play in the SPSB by both reducing the magnitude of over-bidding and under-bidding - in both cases inducing agents to play closer to their true value. For plots of these interventions, we report Figure 11 in the Appendix.
