## 6 CONCLUSION

This paper reports the results of more than 1,000 auction experiments with GPT-4o participants. In particular, we find behavior that conforms with important experimental results with humans (from both in the lab and in the field). We see the main contribution of this work as establishing a framework for considering LLM evidence as proxy for human evidence in mechanism design.

In particular, while this paper focuses on auction design, future work may use LLM sandboxes to test other kinds of economic mechanisms; e.g., voting, matching, contract design, etc. As LLM models are increasingly validated as proxies for human behavior, LLM agents can then be used to obtain what would otherwise be prohibitively expensive evidence. As a provocative example, while ethical and financial constraints make it impossible to run voting experiments at the scale of nations, it may be possible to run such experiments with LLM agents.

Finally, we are particularly interested in the use of LLM-based techniques to generate synthetic data that is useful for informing economic design. In particular, some auction formats, such as combinatorial auctions, are complex and difficult to run frequently and at scale in traditional lab experiments. Augmenting these traditional lab experiments with LLM-agent experiments, when correctly validated, may open up wide new avenues to better understand the design tradeoffs in these kinds of complex and often high-stakes environments.
