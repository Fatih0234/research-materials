## A.1 INDEPENDENT PRIVATE VALUES PROMPTS

Following the simulation procedure outlined in Section 2.2, we employ the following prompts for the auctions tested. For each prompt, only the third paragraph (describing the allocation rule and payment) differ. For the FPSB, we describe the auction format as follows:

- In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num\_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds.
- At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize, randomly drawn between \$0 and \${{private}}, with all values equally likely.

- After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between \$0 and \${{private}} in \${{ increment}} increments.
- The highest bidder wins the prize and pays their bid amount. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by your bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
- After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
