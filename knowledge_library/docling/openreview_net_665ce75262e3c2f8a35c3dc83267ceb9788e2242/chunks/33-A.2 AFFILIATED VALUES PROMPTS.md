## A.2 AFFILIATED VALUES PROMPTS

The affilate-value prompts follows the style of the last section's prompts closely. The only difference is in the first two paragraphs, where agents are informed of the APV environment. For the SPSB, we describe the auction format as follows:

- In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num\_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds.
- At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. First we will randomly draw a common value between {{common\_low}} and {{common\_high}}, with all values equally likely.
2. Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and {{private}}, with all values equally likely.
- Your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.
- After learning your value, you will submit a bid privately at the same time as the other bidders. Bids must be between $0 and ${{common\_high + private}} in ${{increment}} increments.
- The highest bidder wins the prize and pays the secondhighest bid. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the second-highest bid. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
- After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.

The implementation of the clock auction simulates a global clock price, with prices beginning at 0 and increasing in $1 increments. The clock auction format descriptions closely mirror the SPSB format above, but with the added description of the clock mechanism in the fourth and fifth paragraphs. In the AC auction, we describe the auction format as follows:

- In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num\_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds.
- At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. First we will randomly draw a common value between {{common\_low}} and {{common\_high}}, with all values equally likely.
2. Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and {{private}}, with all values equally likely.
- Your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value.
- The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group that starts at 0 and counts upwards in {{ increment}} USD increments, up to a maximum of {{ common\_high + private}}. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction, and anytime a bidder leaves, we will broadcast that information to all the remaining bidders.
- When there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged.
- After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.

The AC-B auction description closely resembles the AC format, but with the explicit caveat that we will not notify bidders when competitors drop out. We describe the auction format as follows:

- In this game, you will participate in an auction for a prize against {{num\_bidders}} other bidders. You will play this game for {{n}} rounds.
- At the start of each round, bidders will see their value for the prize. Your value for the prize will be calculated as follows:
1. First we will randomly draw a common value between {{common\_low}} and {{common\_high}}, with all values equally likely.
2. Then, for each bidder, a private taste adjustment will be drawn between 0 and {{private}}, with all values equally likely.

Your value for the prize is equal to the common value plus your private taste adjustment. You will not learn the common value or your private taste adjustment separately. This means that each person in your group may have a different value for the prize. However, if you have a high value, it is more likely that other people in your group have a high value. The auction proceeds as follows: First, you will learn your value for the prize. Then, the auction will start. We will display a price to everyone in your group that starts at 0 and counts upwards in {{ increment}} USD increments, up to a maximum of {{ common_high + private}}. At any point, you can choose to leave the auction, but we will not tell any bidder when someone leaves. When there is only one bidder left in the auction, that bidder will win the prize at the current price. If you win, your earnings will increase by your value for the prize, and decrease by the current price. If you don't win, your earnings will remain unchanged. After each auction, we will display all bids and the winner's profits. Ties for the highest bid will be resolved randomly.
