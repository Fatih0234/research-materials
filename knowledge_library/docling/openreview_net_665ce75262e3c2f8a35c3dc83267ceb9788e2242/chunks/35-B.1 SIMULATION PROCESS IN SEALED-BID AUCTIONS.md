## B.1 SIMULATION PROCESS IN SEALED-BID AUCTIONS

First, as an overview, a round takes the following form:

1. Planning. LLMagents receive a description of the auction format and are asked to propose a bidding plan.
2. Value Realization. Each LLM agent is assigned a random private value.
3. Bidding. Given their value, each agent places a bid according to their stated plan.
4. Outcome. The system computes allocation and payments. Each LLM agent learns its own profit or loss outcome, as well as the full set of bids submitted (but not other agents' private values).
5. Reflection. Before the next round, each LLM agent reviews the results and possibly revises its approach. These updates are stored in the HISTORY variable.
6. Repetition. One complete 'plan-bid-reflect' loop is one round. We repeat 15 rounds in each experiment, with the entire HISTORY carried forward.

During the auction, LLM agents will be first informed about the scenario. After explaining to them the rules and incentives of the aucion, they will be asked to write down a plan for the bidding.

You are Bidder Andy. You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles. {goal}. {RULE EXPLANATION} Write your plans for what bidding strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself. Your plan should be within 100 words.

Here, the RULE EXPLANATIONS are specific for each type of auctions. A universal goal prompt -'Your TOP PRIORITY is to place bids which maximize the your profit in the long run. ' -is included to incentivize the LLM agents and motivate strategic behaviors; they are universal in all the simulations we ran.

The following is the output from Bidder Andy for the first round in a FPSB auction:

'I plan to initially explore a strategy where I bid half of my value, then varying my bids between 30-70% of my value in subsequent rounds. Sequentially, I will introduce risk by bidding within +/- 5% of the highest bid from previous round, gathering data about other bidder's tendencies. Lastly, based on gathered data, I'll deploy a more aggressive high bid if losses amass, or low-risk bid if leading, to secure profit. Learning from each round is vital to adapt and refine strategy for profit maximization. '

Once they make the bidding plan, the system will inform the LLM agents their value towards the item in this round and ask them to make a bid according to their plan.

```
You are Bidder Andy. You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles. {goal}. {RULE EXPLANATION} Your value is 73. Your plan is {PLAN} FOLLOW YOUR PLAN. How much would you like to bid? Give your response with a single number and no other texts, e.g. 1, 44
```

In this example, Bidder Andy valued the item at $73. And according to his plan, he only wanted to bid 30-70% of his value. So, he bid '36.5' in this round.

After receiving the bids from all the LLM bidder, the system determines the winner and the profits for each bidders. All the bids and the winner's profit are returned back to the bidders along with whether they win the auction in this round. The part of information is included in the HISTORY variable. For sealed-bid auctions, the HISTORY includes the all the bids, the clearing price, winner's profit, this agent's value, agent's bid and whether they won the auction in that round. An example of the history briefing is provided below:

'The previous round histories along with your plans are: In round 0, Your value was 86, you bid 86.0, and your profit was 0.0. Your total profit is 0.0. All the bids for this round were 86.0, 56.0, 21.0. The highest bidder won with a bid of 86.0 and would've preferred to bid 57.0. The winner's profit was 0.0. Did you win the auction: Yes. '

Before entering the next round, the bidders are asked to do a reflection upon their bidding strategy and the result.

```

An example of Bidder Andy's reflection is provided below. Since he didn't win the auction and incurred a zero profit, his reflection was that bidding up closer to his true value would help him win the game and secure a net profit.

'If I bid down by a few dollars, say around $30, I likely still wouldn't have won given the winning bid was $57. I would've merely saved my bid money. If I bid up by $21, matching the winning bid of $57, I may or may not have won due to the random resolution of ties. However, if I'd won, my profit would have been $16, realizing the difference between my value of $73 and my raised bid. So, bidding aggressively could potentially increase my profits in such scenarios. '

In the following new round, all the bidders are asked to update their plans according to the history of the last round and their reflections.

```
You are Bidder Andy. You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles. {goal}. {RULE EXPLANATION} The previous round history is: {HISTORY} After careful reflection on previous bidding, your analysis for last round is {REFLECTION}. Learn from your previous rounds, Let's think step by step to make sure we make a good choice. Write your plans for what bidding strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself LIMIT your plan to 50 words.
```

Here, we show the updated plan for the second round of the same Bidder Andy. After learning from the lessons of bidding only 50% of the value and losing the game, this time the agent updates their plan to the following:

'I plan to test higher bidding strategies, around two-thirds of the prize value to foster winning chances. Additionally, if my prize value is extremely high, I will bid aggressively for data-gathering. '

This plan-bid-reflection loop will iterate until the end of the auction. After the last bid, no reflection will be queried. In the IPV setting, there are overall 15 rounds for all the sealed-bid auctions. In the affiliated and common value auctions, there are overall 10 rounds.
