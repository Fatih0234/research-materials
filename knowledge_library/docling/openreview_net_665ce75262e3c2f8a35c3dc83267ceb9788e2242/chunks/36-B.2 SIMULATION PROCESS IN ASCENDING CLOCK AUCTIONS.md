## B.2 SIMULATION PROCESS IN ASCENDING CLOCK AUCTIONS

In Ascending Clock Auctions, each round consists of multiple clock cycles, during which every bidder is asked whether they want to stay or drop out at the current clock price. In the first round, bidders are reminded of the auction rules, similar to those outlined in Section B.1. The auction starts with an initial price of 0, which increases incrementally until only one bidder remains or two bidders drop out simultaneously, in which case the winner is chosen randomly. The detailed prompt is listed as follows, with variables enclosed in brackets:

```
You are Bidder Andy. You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles. {goal} {RULE EXPLANATION} Your value towards to the prize is 26 in this round. The current price in this clock cycle is {current_price}. The price for next clock cycle is {current_price + increment}.
```

```
The previous bidding history is: {transcript}. {Asking Prompt}
```

To implement plan-bid-reflection within each clock cycle, we modified the Asking Prompt as follows, inspired by Fish et al. (2024):

```
Do you want to stay in the bidding? If you choose yes, you can keep bidding for next clock. If you choose No, you will exit and have no chance to re-enter the bidding. Your response must use these EXACT tags below. You must output the ACTION. ''' <PLAN> [Write your plans for what bidding strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself. LIMIT your plan to 50 words. ] </PLAN> <ACTION> Yes or No </ACTION> <REFLECTION> think about how to justify your choice </REFLECTION> '''
```

In AC, if LLM bidders didn't decide to drop out in the first round, they are shown the previous bidding history for the next clock cycle. The history includes the price and how many people had dropped out. And the transcript variable will be the following format:

```
The previous biddings are: ['In clock round 1, the price was 1, no players dropped out'].
```

In AC-B, we don't show the previous biddings and in each clock cycle, we directly query LLM agents' decision. So the transcript variable will be None.

A clock auction round ends when only one bidder remains, who is declared the winner, or when two bidders drop out simultaneously, in which case the winner is chosen randomly. Each auction consists of 10 independent rounds with affiliated value settings.
