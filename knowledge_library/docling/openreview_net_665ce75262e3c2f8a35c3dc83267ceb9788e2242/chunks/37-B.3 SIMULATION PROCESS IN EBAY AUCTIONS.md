## B.3 SIMULATION PROCESS IN EBAY AUCTIONS

We model continuous time in the synthetic, modified eBay auction environment as follows: each period, bidders bid (i.e., decide whether to increase their maximum bid or hold) in a common knowledge, randomly-permuted order (e.g., today Charles, then Alice, then Betty will bid; tomorrow, Alice, then Betty, then Charles). Moreover, each bidder can decide whether to increase their maximum bid with knowledge of the updated state of the auction based on the actions of bidders that precede them that period. In the final period, bidding is simultaneous and no bidder will know whether they are the last bidder (simulating that, in a continuous time auction, you cannot know if another bidder will get a bid in between you and the auction's close). Under the modified closing rule, if a higher bid is placed in the final period such that there is a new winner, the auction is extended by an additional period. This process continues until no further bids are made.

In particular, for our eBay auctions, we discretize the continuous bidding period into 10 periods. Each period, LLM agents decide whether to increase their bid or hold their current bid. The bidding process follows a structured format, where bidders act in a predefined sequence each period (e.g., Charles, then Alice, then Betty). Agents are informed of past price changes through a transcript, such as 'On day 1, the price changed to 1. On day 2, the price changed to 3.'

The prompt provides key details, including the bidder's private value, the total number of bidding days, the current day, the bidding order, previous bids, previous proxy bids, and the current price.

```
You are Bidder Andy. You are bidding with Bidder Betty, Bidder Charles. {goal} {RULE EXPLANATION} Your private value for this item is ${private_value}. This is the maximum amount you are willing to pay. Keep this value private. There are in total {total_periods} days of bidding and this is day {current_period}. {ordering}. Your previous bids are {previous_bid}. If you have already placed bids, you can only increase your bid or hold your current bid. The previous proxy bids are: {transcript}. The current price is {current_price}. {Asking Prompt}
```

The decision-making process is again guided by a structured asking prompt that enforces bidding rules and strategic reflection.

```
Your response must use these EXACT tags below. Don't miss the amount. ''' <PLAN>[ Write your plans for what bidding strategies to test next. Be detailed and precise but keep things succinct and don't repeat yourself. LIMIT your plan to 50 words. ] </PLAN> <CHECK> your last bid is {{last_bid_amount}}, you cannot bid lower that this value </CHECK> <ACTION> BID or HOLD </ACTION> <AMOUNT> if BID, enter a number here, e.g. 1, 44. If HOLD, enter 0 </AMOUNT> '''
