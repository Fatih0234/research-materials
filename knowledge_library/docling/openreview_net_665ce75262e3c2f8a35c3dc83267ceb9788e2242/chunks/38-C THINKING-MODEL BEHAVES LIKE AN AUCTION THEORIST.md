## C THINKING-MODEL BEHAVES LIKE AN AUCTION THEORIST

As discussed in Section 2.1, our primary methodology avoids RL-post-trained models, like the GPTo3. This is because thinking-models act as a game theory expert, identifying the underlying structure of the problem and directly computing the optimal solution.

The following examples illustrate this distinction for two common auction types, using a hypothetical private value of $73.
