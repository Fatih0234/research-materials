## C.1 EXAMPLE 1: FIRST-PRICE SEALED-BID AUCTION

In a standard three-bidder, first-price sealed-bid auction with private values uniformly distributed from $0 to $99, the model was prompted to determine its bid. Rather than generating a bid based on heuristics or simulated intuition, the model correctly identified and applied the Bayes-Nash Equilibrium (BNE) strategy:

For the first round with a valuation of 73, I can apply the symmetric Bayes-Nash equilibrium formula. It's a first-price auction with 3 bidders and uniform valuations from 0 to 99. The bid is roughly 2/3 of 73, which rounds to 49. So, I'll go with a bid of 49.
