## C.2 EXAMPLE 2: SECOND-PRICE SEALED-BID AUCTION

When presented with a second-price sealed-bid auction (also known as a Vickrey auction) with the same parameters, the model again defaulted to an expert analysis. It immediately identified the dominant strategy for this auction type:

The scenario gives three bidders, with uniform private values between 0 and 99 in a second-price auction. The strategy is to bid truthfully because it's a Vickrey auction. I should bid 73, matching the value, and avoid any distractions like testing with increments. The answer is clear: 73.

These responses, while correct from a game-theoretic perspective, do not represent the type of boundedly rational or heuristic-driven behavior that is often observed in human participants and which our main study aims to simulate. This clear divergence in behavior validates our methodological choice to use direct prompting over more complex, reasoning-eliciting approaches.
