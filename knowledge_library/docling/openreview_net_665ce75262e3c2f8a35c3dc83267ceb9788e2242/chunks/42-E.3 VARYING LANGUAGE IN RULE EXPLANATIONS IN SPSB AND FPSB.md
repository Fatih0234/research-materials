## E.3 VARYING LANGUAGE IN RULE EXPLANATIONS IN SPSB AND FPSB

1129 1130 1131 1132 1133 We also tested our existing prompts using different languages (specifically, Spanish, Chinese, Russian and Hindi) with the results presented in Figure 7. It is interesting that the Russian version of FPSB appears to be a stark outlier, with the LLM agent bidding close to the true value even in the first-price auction. For other languages, bids in the second-price auction are generally higher than those in the first-price auction and results qualitatively unchanged from those reported in main body of paper.
