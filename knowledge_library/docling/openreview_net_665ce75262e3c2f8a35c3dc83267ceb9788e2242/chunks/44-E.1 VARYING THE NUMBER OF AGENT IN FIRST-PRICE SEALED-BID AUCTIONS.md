## E.1 VARYING THE NUMBER OF AGENT IN FIRST-PRICE SEALED-BID AUCTIONS

In FPSB auctions, the theoretically optimal bidding strategy varies based on the number of agents participating. As the number of agents increases, we would expect individual bidders to reduce the extent of bid shading.

To examine this effect, we conducted experiments with FPSB auctions involving 4 and 5 agents, as shown in Fig 5. As the number of agents increases, the Loess-smoothed data curve remains consistently higher than, or approximately aligned with, the predictions of the Bayes-Nash equilibrium. Moreover, we observed variations below the theoretical optimum, along with a few data points exceeding the predicted values. These findings echoes with existing empirical works for first-price auctions (Cox et al., 1988), suggesting that the observed patterns persist across different settings.
