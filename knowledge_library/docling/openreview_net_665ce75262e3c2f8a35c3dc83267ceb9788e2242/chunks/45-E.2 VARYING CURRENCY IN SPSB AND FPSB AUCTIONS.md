## E.2 VARYING CURRENCY IN SPSB AND FPSB AUCTIONS

Additionally, we also tested the prompts in different currencies (specifically, the Euro, the Ruble, the Yen and the Rupee) with the results presented in Figure 6. As is evident from the plots for both the SPSB and FPSB auctions, the key features of the FPSB and SPSB simulation results reported in the main text remain consistent and unchanged in these variations.
