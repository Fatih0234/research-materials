## G STATISTICAL TEST FOR OSP

Below is Table 3, which reports statistical tests for the difference between the SPSB, AC-B and AC auctions.

Table 3: Two-sample t-tests comparing the mean absolute difference between bids and values in the AC, AC-B and SPSB auctions in an APV setting . Results demonstrate that both clock auctions have lower mean absolute difference between bid and value vs the sealed-bid auction. However, the clock auctions themselves are not significantly different. Bid data for clock auctions is excluding winners.

| Comparison     |   t-statistic |   p-value |
