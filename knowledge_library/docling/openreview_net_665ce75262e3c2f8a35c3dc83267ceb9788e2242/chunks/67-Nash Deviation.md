## Nash Deviation

First, come up with a possible bid given your value. Then, think through your bidding strategy step by step. How do you expect others to bid? If others bid like this and you bid down, what happens? If others bid like this and you bid up, what happens? Think through all the ways you could deviate from your current bidding strategy, and settle on the best possible strategy.
