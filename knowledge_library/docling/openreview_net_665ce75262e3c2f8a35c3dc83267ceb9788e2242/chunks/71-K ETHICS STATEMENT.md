## K ETHICS STATEMENT

This work proposed a new method to generate synthetic data for designing more efficient auctions. This may lead to more equitable and efficient resource allocation outcomes if there are new design generated through our methodology. Our experiments are purely based on LLM simulation and compare prior lab data, and no new data was collected from human subjects.
