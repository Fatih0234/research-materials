## (b) 2-choice prompt for the shock classifier.

The experimenter observed Mr. Wagner's action and noted whether Mr. Wagner did shock or did not shock the victim.

Action: Mr. Wagner shocks the learner with a slight shock of 45 volts and moves on to the next question.

Experimenter's note: Mr. Wagner did

Figure 6. Prompts used during the Milgram Shock TE. (a) A freeresponse prompt with past subject completions and information for the current stage. The LM should describe the simulated subject's behavior. (b) The simulated subject's obedience or disobedience dictates which predetermined experimenter reaction is appended to the prompt. The classification is made with a 2-choice experimenter judgement prompt with valid completions of shock or not shock . The completion (italicized for emphasis) from Mr. Wagner's prompt above is inserted into this prompt.

Milgram's (1963) procedure. Our full simulation procedure is presented in Appendix F.

Figure 6 illustrates some of the prompts used. Since the prompts resulted in open-ended text generation, a separate classification step was used to determine whether the free text reflected a shock or did-not-shock action by the subject. In essence, we are simulating how the experimenter would respond to the subjects behavior according to the protocol, thus we are simulating both the subject and experimenter.

Figure 7. Comparing TE simulations to Milgram's results. At 300 volts (the 20th shock) the victim starts refusing to participate in the experiment by pounding on the walls and not selecting an answer, and the experimenter tells the subject to shock the victim. In Milgram (1963) Experiment 1, 26 out of 40 participants followed the experimenter's instructions until the end of the shock series. In the Milgram Shock TE, 75 out of 100 simulated participants followed the experimenter's instructions until the end.

Figure 7 shows the overall finding of diminishing obedience throughout the multiple levels of the experiment, spiking at shock voltage level 300 when the 'victim' starts refusing to participate in the experiment. Further details on procedure, analysis, and our novel destructive obedience scenario are deferred to Appendix F. The novel scenario differs from the Milgram Shock setup and addresses the concern that the model training data includes the Milgram Shock experiment.
