Figure 8. Comparing Wisdom of Crowds TE simulation estimates to human results for the five questions from Moussa¨ ıd et al. (2013). As LMs become larger and more aligned, they are more likely to complete the TE prompt with inhumanly accurate answers. Estimates are normalized by dividing by the correct answer. Bars indicate the median normalized estimate, and black lines indicate the quartiles. All simulations for LM-6 (as well as ChatGPT and GPT-4) have a median of 1.0 with 0.0 IQR. Results from all LMs are in Appendix E.
