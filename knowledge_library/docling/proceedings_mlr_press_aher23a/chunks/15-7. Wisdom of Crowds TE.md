Phenomenon. In many cases, aggregating group estimates of a quantity have significantly less error than the error of most individuals. In early work, Galton (1907) recorded 787 estimates of the weight of a given ox, and found that that the median of 787 estimates had a 9 lb. error (less than 1%), despite the variation among the estimates: a 74 lb. interquartile range (IQR-the difference between 75th and 25th percentiles). Similar findings have been reported across an array of domains (Page, 2007; Surowiecki, 2004).

The domain we focus on is general-knowledge questions. Moussa¨ ıd et al. (2013) conducted a study in which 52 subjects answered questions such as 'How many bones does an adult human have?' We selected 5 general-knowledge questions and created our own 5 additional questions. Figure 8 clearly shows the hyper-accuracy distortion increasingly present. In the extreme case, the LM-6 simulations has a majority of all simulated participants giving exactly correct answers to all 10 questions. The questions, answers and statistics for all 6 models are given in Appendix E.
