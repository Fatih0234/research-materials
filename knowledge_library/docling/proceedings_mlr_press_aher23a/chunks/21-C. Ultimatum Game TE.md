## C. Ultimatum Game TE

This section contains further details for the Ultimatum Game TE. First, Figure 9 contains the average responder acceptance rates for all five models, LM 1-5. LM-1 and LM-2 show no offer sensitivity and tend to generate simulation records that indicate that responders always accept. LM-3 shows no offer sensitivity and tends to generate simulation records that indicate that responders always reject. LM-4 predicts that some respondents (60% on average) accept an offer of $0 and all respondents accept an offer of $10, but overall has little offer sensitivity. Only LM-5 has offer sensitivity that aligns to expectations of real human behavior.

Figure 9. Mean fraction of responder accept for LM-1 through LM-5 for offers of $0 through $10.
