Figure 10. (a) Simulated ratings (using LM-1 through LM-5) and human ratings on the same set of garden path sentences (Christianson et al., 2001). LMs results for average fraction of ungrammatical . Error bars show the standard error of the mean across the per-sentence average fraction of ungrammatical . Human results for proportion of persistent misunderstanding. (b) The average ungrammatical probability of garden path sentences versus their corresponding control sentences, for LM-1 through LM-5.
