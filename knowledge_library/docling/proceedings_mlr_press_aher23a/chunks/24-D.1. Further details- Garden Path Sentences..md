Figure 13a compares the mean simulated ungrammatical judgments to human ratings across sentence types. Compared to the simulated results with sentences from Christianson et al. (2001), the relative difficulty of sentences with RAT verbs and OT verbs have switched, but the general finding that garden path sentences are more likely to be misinterpreted as ungrammatical compared to the control sentences is still evident. LM-5 exhibits the strongest difference in ratings between control sentences and garden path sentences. Results from simulations using LMs 3-4 also support the same conclusion, though the differences are not as large. Lastly, Figure 13b show that trends of average ungrammatical fraction in garden path compared to control sentences on the sentences authored by us show trends similar to those observed on sentences from Christianson et al. (2001).
