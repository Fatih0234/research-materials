## E. Wisdom of Crowds TE

This section provides details for the Wisdom of Crowds TE, which was introduced in Section 7.

Inputs. As in the other simulations, we use the same set of 500 racially diverse surnames. In this study alone, we consider three titles: Mr. , Ms. , and Mx. , where Mx. is intended to be a non-binary title. This illustrates how easy it is to run a simulation of a minority group, though we lack human estimates annotated by gender to compare to. Thus, in total, there were 1,500 total simulated combinations of title and surname. We selected five questions from those of (Moussa¨ ıd et al., 2013) which were considered general-knowledge in the sense that there was general agreement upon the answer and for which the answer is not something that would change over time. We then authored five additional general knowledge questions. The 10 questions and their answers are shown in Table 3.

Simulation. The simulator uses a free-response prompt, illustrated in Figure 14. In pilot simulations, the validity rate was quite low because, rather than producing numeric estimates, the LMs would generate full sentences, as seen in the example of the nine-year-old in the Introduction. Valid completions must be integers (commas and spaces are ignored). As seen in Table 1, validity rates for the large models were high.

Ms. Huang was asked the following question. They were not allowed to consult any external sources and were instructed to make their best guess if they were unsure. Their answer was written as an integer using digits 0-9.

Question (text): [How many bones does an adult human have?]

Ms. Huang's answer (integer): [

Results. As mentioned, LM-6 was released just prior to running this TE, so this TE was run on six LMs. The validity rates of the larger models are close to 100%, as seen in Table 1. Table 3 gives the full results for all six LMs. All answers are integers. The first five questions are from Moussa¨ ıd et al. (2013).

A 0 IQR rate means that all values agree from the first to third quartile, implying that a majority of the simulated responses were identical.

Wisdom vs. Alignment Due to the (perhaps) surprising discovery of the hyper-accuracy distortion, we hypothesized that the instruct 'alignment' may be the cause. To test this hypothesis, we further evaluated on all available versions of GPT models available from OpenAI at the time of publication: davinci , text-davinci-001 , text-davinci-002 , text-davinci-003 , which presumably involved increasing amounts of alignment, respectively. Results, shown in Figure 15 (which includes recent runs with ChatGPT ( gpt-35-turbo and plus model gpt-4 ), are consistent with this hypothesis. However, the specific details of the LMs in question have not been released.
