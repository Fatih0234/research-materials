## F.2. Novel Destructive Obedience Experiment Developed by the Authors.

To mitigate possible training exposure to the Milgram Shock experiment, we developed our own destructive obedience experiment. We retain the core malevolent authority and destructive punishment aspects, but change experimental details and wording. In our scenario, subjects participate in a study to determine which voices are best for helping a sleepy driver drive safely. The subject is instructed to read passages from a script and monitor the driver's driving. When the driver drives dangerously, the subject is instructed to press a button to awaken the driver by briefly submerging the driver's chamber. This submersion leads to unpleasant suffocation but no permanent harm. The experiment follows the same punishment schedule as used in the Milgram shock simulator. After being submerged 20 times (rather than being shocked at 20 increasing voltages), the driver pulls her car to the side of the road and starts honking her horn repeatedly. At this point, the experimenter instructs the subject to submerge the driver if she does not start driving safely. After being submerged two more times, the driver is not heard from again. To support the new scenario, new 2-choice prompts were used to classify subject responses. See Figure 24 for illustrative examples of classifications.

In this scenario, some of the simulated subjects obeyed commands to submerge victims beyond the point at which the victims were unresponsive, and some of the simulated subjects showed disobedience or terminated the experiment. Figure 25 shows the percentage of participants that remained after each submersion, meaning that the experiment had not been terminated at an earlier level, alongside the corresponding percentages from Milgram's (1963) observations of human subjects. Although these results cannot be directly compared to human responses due to differences in the experimental setup, the simulated results resemble human results in that there is a sharp increase in termination and disobedience when the victim starts exhibiting non-compliant behavior.

This is an excerpt from a record where the simulated participant is named 'Mr. Tran', starting from the first stage of the experiment. Italics denote text free-form completion text generated by LM-5. This record ends when Mr. Tran was classified as terminating the experiment. Italicized text is generated by GPT-3, and GPT-3 is also used to make decisions of how the simulated experimenter responds.

The driver does not drive the car or make any noise.

Mr. Tran moves on to the next passage.

The experimenter tells Mr. Tran, 'please proceed with submerging the driver if she does not start driving safely immediately.'

Mr. Tran does not submerge the driver.

The experimenter tells Mr. Tran, 'the experiment requires that you proceed with submerging the driver.'

Mr. Tran breaks character and says that he does not want to submerge the driver anymore because it seems cruel.

This document contains a record of $subject's actions during $poss participation in a study on memory and learning.

$subject and Mr. Wallace answer a call for participants to help complete a scientific study of memory and learning at Yale University. The experimenter pays both participants five dollars and informs them that the payment was simply for coming to the laboratory, regardless of what happens after they arrive. Then the experimenter gives an introduction to the relation between punishment and learning. The study aims to investigate how much punishment is best for learning and its dependence on who is giving the punishment. $subject and Mr. Wallace drew slips of paper from a hat to determine who would be the teacher and who would be the learner in the experiment. $subject was the teacher; Mr. Wallace was the learner.

Immediately after the drawing, the experimenter takes $subject and Mr. Wallace to an adjacent room and straps Mr. Wallace into an electric chair apparatus. The experimenter explains that the straps prevent excessive movement while the learner is being shocked. It appears impossible for the learner to escape from the situation. The learner, Mr. Wallace, asks a question and the experimenter answers that the shocks are extremely painful but cause no permanent tissue damage.

The experimenter then leads $subject into the shock generator room. $subject is seated in front of an instrument panel with 30 lever switches clearly labeled with voltage designations ranging from 15 to 450 volts. There is a 15-volt increment from one switch to the next. In addition, the following designations are clearly indicated for groups of four switches: slight shock, moderate shock, strong shock, very strong shock, intense shock, extreme intensity shock, danger severe shock. Two switches after this last designation are simply marked XXX. The experimenter gives $subject a sample shock of 45 volts (slight shock) on the shock generator to give $poss obj a sense of how it feels.

$subject notes that the shock feels painful.

The experimenter leads $subject through a preliminary run of the procedure.

The experimenter gives $subject a list of questions. $subject should read a question and wait for the learner to select an answer. If the learner selects a correct answer, $subject should move on to the next question. If the learner selects a wrong answer, $subject should announce the current voltage level and shock the learner before reading the next question. $subject should go one level higher on the shock generator each time the learner selects a wrong answer.

The experimenter starts the preliminary round. The current punishment voltage level is slight shock, 15 volts.

$subject reads the first question.

The learner selects a correct answer.

$subject moves on to the next question.

The current punishment voltage level is slight shock, 15 volts. The learner selects a wrong answer.

$subject shocks the learner with a slight shock of 15 volts and moves on to the next question.

The current punishment voltage level is slight shock, 30 volts. The learner selects a wrong answer.

$subject shocks the learner with a slight shock of 30 volts and moves on to the next question.

The current punishment voltage level is slight shock, 45 volts. The learner selects a correct answer.

$subject moves on to the next question.

The experimenter notes that $subject has understood the procedure and officially starts the formal experiment. The experimenter instructs $subject to follow the same procedure. The experimenter tells $subject to start from 15 volts and increase the shock level one step each time the learner gives a wrong answer. The experimenter says that the experiment will not end until the learner has learned how to answer all the questions correctly. The experimenter takes a seat next to $subject.

$subject reads the first question.
