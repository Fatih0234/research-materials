## (b) 2-choice prompt to determine whether the driver was submerged

The experimenter observed $subject's action and noted whether $subject did punish or did not punish the victim. Punishments are delivered by pressing a button to submerge the victim.

Action: $subject$action

Experimenter's note: $subject did

not punish

Figure 28. The novel destructive obedience 2-choice prompts for determining (a) termination and (b) obedience. $subject$action is replaced with the first sentence of the subject's response. In (a) the completion considered is not stop . In (b) the completion considered is not punish .
