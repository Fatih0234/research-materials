## 3 Do LLM Agents Manifest Trust Behavior?

In this section, we investigate whether or not LLM agents manifest trust behavior by letting LLM agents play the Trust Game (Section 2.1 Game 1). In Behavioral Economics, trust is widely measured by the initial amount sent from the trustor to the trustee in the Trust Game (Glaeser et al., 2000; Cesarini et al., 2008). Following the measurement of trust in human studies and the assumption humans own reasoning processes that underlie their decisions, we can define the conditions that LLM agents manifest trust behavior in the Trust Game as follows. First , the amount sent is positive and does not exceed the amount of money the trustor initially possesses , which implies that the trustor places self-

interest at risk with the expectation the trustee will reciprocate and that the trustor understands the money limit that can be given. Second , the decision ( i.e. , amounts sent) can be interpreted as the reasoning process ( i.e. , the BDI) of the trustor . We explored utilizing BDI to model the reasoning process of LLM agents. If we can interpret the decision as the articulated reasoning process, we have evidence that LLM agents do not send a random amount of money and manifest some degree of rationality in the decision-making process. Then, we assess whether LLM agents exhibit trust behavior based on two aspects: the amount sent and the BDI.
