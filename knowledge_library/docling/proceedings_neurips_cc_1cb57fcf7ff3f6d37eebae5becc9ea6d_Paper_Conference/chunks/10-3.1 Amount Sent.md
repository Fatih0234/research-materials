## 3.1 Amount Sent

To evaluate LLMs' capacity to understand the basic experimental setting regarding money limits, we propose a new evaluation metric, Valid Response Rate (VRR) (%), defined as the percentage of personas with the amount sent falling within the initial money ( $10 ). Results are shown in Figure 2. We can observe that most LLMs have a high VRR except Llama-7b , which implies that most LLMs manifest a full understanding regarding limits on the amount they can send in the Trust Game. Then, we observe the distribution of amounts sent for different LLMs as the trustor agent and discover that the amounts sent are predominantly positive, indicating a level of trust .
