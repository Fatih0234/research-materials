## 5.1 Is Agent Trust Biased?

Extensive studies have shown that LLMs may have biases and stereotypes against specific demographics (Gallegos et al., 2023). Nevertheless, it is under-explored whether LLM agent behaviors also maintain such biases in simulation. To address this, we explicitly specified the gender of the trustee and explored its influence on agent trust. Based on measuring the amount sent, we find that the trustee's gender information exerts a moderate impact on LLM agent trust behavior, which reflects intrinsic gender bias in agent trust . We also observe that the amount sent to female players is higher than that sent to male players for most LLM agents. For example, GPT-4 agents send higher amounts to female players compared with male players ( $0 . 55 vs. $ -0 . 21 ). This demonstrates

Figure 7: The Change of Average Amount Sent for LLM Agents in Different Scenarios in the Trust Game, Reflecting the Intrinsic Properties of Agent Trust . The horizontal lines represent the original amount sent in the Trust Game. The green part embraces trustee scenarios including changing the demographics of the trustee, and setting humans and agents as the trustee. The purple part consists of trustor scenarios including adding manipulation instructions and changing the reasoning strategies.
