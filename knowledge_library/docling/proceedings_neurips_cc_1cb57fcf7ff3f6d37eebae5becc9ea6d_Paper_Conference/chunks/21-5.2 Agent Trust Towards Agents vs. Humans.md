## 5.2 Agent Trust Towards Agents vs. Humans

Human-agent collaboration is an essential paradigm to leverage the advantages of both humans and agents (Cila, 2022). As a result, it is essential to understand whether LLM agents display distinctive levels of trust towards agents versus humans. To examine this, we specified the identity of the trustee as LLM agents or humans and probed its effect on the trust behaviors of the trustor. As shown in Figure 7, we observe that most LLM agents send more money to humans compared with agents. For example, the amount sent to humans is much higher than that sent to agents for Vicuna-33b ( $0 . 40 vs. $ -0 . 84 ). This signifies that LLMagents are inclined to place more trust in humans than agents , which potentially validates the advantage of LLM-agent collaboration.
