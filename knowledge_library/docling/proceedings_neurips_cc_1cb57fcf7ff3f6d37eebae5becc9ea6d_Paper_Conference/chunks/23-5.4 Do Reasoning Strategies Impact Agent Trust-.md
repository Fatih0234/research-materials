## 5.4 Do Reasoning Strategies Impact Agent Trust?

It has been shown that advanced reasoning strategies such as zero-shot Chain of Thought (CoT) (Kojima et al., 2022) can make a significant impact on a variety of tasks. It remains unknown, however, whether reasoning strategies can impact LLM agent behaviors. Here, we applied CoT reasoning strategy on the trustor and compared the results with their original trust behaviors. Figure 7 shows that most LLM agents change the amount sent to the trustee under the CoT reasoning strategy, which suggests that reasoning strategies may influence LLM agents' trust behavior . Nevertheless, the impact of CoT on agent trust may also be limited for some types of LLM agents. For example, the amount sent from GPT-4 agent only increases by $0 . 02 under CoT. More research is required to fully understand the relationship between reasoning strategies and LLM agents' behaviors.

Therefore, our third core finding on the intrinsic properties of agent trust can be summarized as:

Finding 3: LLM agents' trust behaviors have demographic biases on gender and races, demonstrate a relative preference for human over other LLM agents, are easier to undermine than to enhance, and may be influenced by reasoning strategies.
