## 1 Introduction

'Between the idea and the reality . . . falls the shadow.'

T. S. Eliot , 'The Hollow Men,'

Monetary policy deliberations and the actual rate decision are separated by a 'shadow' of persuasion and norms. Decisions by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reflect more than macroeconomic data and formal models; they also depend on members' experience, behavioral biases, and implicit rules (e.g., Hughes and Fehrler, 2015; Haldane, 2018; Maih et al., 2021). Consequently, who participates in the deliberation and how information is communicated can influence policy outcomes beyond the underlying economic data.

Precisely because of these behavioral forces, traditional models of committee decision making, though useful and mathematically elegant, often miss the complexities of real world interactions. Behavioral economics highlights how biases, well documented by Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and shown to affect monetary policy (Haldane, 2018), can systematically shape decisions. Information design matters too: Bayesian persuasion demonstrates how agenda setters steer beliefs (Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011). Separately, robust control preferences reveal how officials facing model uncertainty skew choices toward caution (Hansen and Sargent, 2008). Within the FOMC, policy outcomes depend on the committee's composition, from regional voting rotation (e.g., Fos and Xu, 2025) to individual members' policy leanings (e.g., Hack et al., 2023).

To better capture such frictions, researchers increasingly use computational approaches, such as agent-based models (Dwarakanath et al., 2024) and reinforcement learning (Hinterlang and Tänzer, 2021). Large language models (LLMs) further extend the frontier by enabling agents with coherent communication and emergent behavior. LLM-based generative agents simulate realistic social interactions (Park et al., 2022) and market dynamics (Zhang et al., 2024), opening new possibilities for policy experimentation (Argyle et al., 2022; Horton, 2023).

However, no existing approach lets us observe rational and behavioral decision

rules on the same information set. We address this gap with a dual track simulation framework that integrates an LLM-driven simulation of the FOMC meeting with a game theory voting model. In the rational (game theory) track, policymakers observe macro data, update beliefs via Bayesian inference, and vote to an equilibrium. In the behavioral (LLM) track, the agents get the same data, reason in natural language, engage in committee debate, and generate outcomes shaped not only by the data but also by persona heterogeneity and institutional norms that formal models struggle to capture. Recent studies show that LLM-based agents can reproduce various aspects of market dynamics (e.g., Kazinnik, 2023; Manning et al., 2024; Lopez-Lira, 2025); we apply the same logic to monetary policy. We generalize the Riboni and RugeMurcia (2010) framework to admit heterogeneous preferences, strategic information disclosure, and a political pressure channel. Deviations between the LLM equilibrium and the analytic benchmark then isolate the behavioral frictions that standard models omit.

Specifically, we construct and run two types of simulations: a set of LLMdriven deliberations and a parallel Monte Carlo (MC) analysis. Both start from the same LLM-generated set of heterogeneous private opinions, reflecting FOMC members' profiles and the current economic state. The MC simulation serves as a statistical baseline, modeling thousands of voting scenarios under theoretical framework described in Riboni and Ruge-Murcia (2010). The LLM simulation, by contrast, introduces deliberation, persuasion, and strategic interaction, capturing human-like dynamics. Comparing the two allows us to isolate and measure the impact of deliberation by identifying where LLM-driven outcomes diverge from the statistical baseline.

Within the framework, we start by automatically ingesting real-time macroeconomic data, Governor speeches, district-level reports, and financial news. We then build detailed profiles for each committee member, combining their historical policy stances, biographies, recent speeches, district conditions, and the current macroeconomic context. 1 Each agent draws on this information to generate an initial

rate recommendation, comprising a preferred policy rate, a confidence score, and a short explanation, capturing the agent's initial belief.

With these agent profiles and initial beliefs in place, we launch the simulation to model the decision-making process under two approaches. The LLM simulation begins with several optional rounds of informal coordination to align member views. 2 The simulation then enters a deliberation stage, where a discussion engine records arguments and updates members' initial beliefs, and concludes with a structured voting phase in which members submit final rate preferences for automatic aggregation and comparison. Outputs include posterior beliefs, vote patterns with dissent diagnostics, and full deliberation logs. The MC framework uses the same priors and economic parameters but removes conversational and behavioral dynamics, running thousands of rule-based voting scenarios to generate a statistical baseline. We benchmark the LLM results against MC ones.

To showcase the framework, we simulate two scenarios. The first one introduces the effects of a politically charged environment on the committee. This treatment contains two distinct but related elements, designed to model both the direct pressure on the current Chair and the indirect, forward-looking behavior of the other committee members. The first component targets the Chair directly: we apply a dovish bias in the Chair's agenda proposal. Simultaneously, the Chair's institutional authority is diminished by removing the extra voting weight their ballot typically carries. The second component of the treatment models the strategic, forward looking behavior of the other committee members who anticipate an imminent regime change. Anticipating a more dovishly inclined successor 3 , members face asymmetric career incentives, so dissent costs are direction-dependent: hawkish votes carry a higher penalty, while dovish votes are cheaper, signaling alignment with the expected regime. 4

The second scenario examines the consequences of a sudden negative labor market data revision. This treatment feeds into the simulation as a downward adjustment

to the perceived strength of payroll growth, paired with an increase in the assessed uncertainty of employment sensitive members. By modeling this as a real-time information shock, we capture how the timing and nature of data updates can meaningfully reshape deliberation and decision making. In our framework, when members receive new information plays a critical role in shaping the path of discussion, belief updating, and ultimately, the policy vote.

Our findings are as follows. In the baseline LLM scenario, simulating economic conditions as of late July 2025 (when the target FFR stood at 4.25%-4.50%, and effective FFR stood at 4.33%), the committee starts off with a moderately hawkish tilt, with individual rate preferences spanning 4.20% (for simulated Christopher Waller, or sim Waller) to 4.62% (for simulated Alberto Musalem, or sim Musalem) and clustering at the upper end of the range. 5 The average initial recommendation across members is at 4.375%, with a belief spread of just over 55 basis points. As deliberations unfold, hawks emphasize the persistence of above-target inflation. 6 The committee converges unanimously on a final rate of 4.42%, implying an upward drift of roughly 5 basis points in the midpoint federal funds rate (4.375%) without changing the 4.25%-4.50% range. Parallel Monte Carlo simulations, which remove conversational dynamics, also converge near the existing range but yield a slightly lower mean of 4.376%. Outcomes cluster tightly and no dissents occur. Debate thus introduces a modest hawkish bias of around 5 basis points, relative to rule-based voting.

Next, political pressure scenario (mirroring public attacks by the POTUS on Chair Powell) reduces the Chair's agenda weight, applies a dovish bias to his proposal, and imposes career-driven dovish shifts for members with high appointment probabilities ( sim Waller, and, to lesser extent sim Bowman). Member views polarize: sim Waller's

5 The range midpoint is 4.375%; 7 of 12 members are above it and the mean (4.39%) is slightly higher.

6 For example, in one simulation, sim Waller warns that ' ..if we allow inflation to spiral further, it may lead to more significant economic instability ,' while simulated sim Schmid stresses that ' allowing inflation to persist unchecked can have long-term detrimental effects on both employment and economic growth, ' particularly if expectations become ' unanchored . ' By the final discussion round, the effect of these arguments is visible: sim Powell shifts position, noting that ' the current inflation data cannot be overlooked ' and proposing a move to 4.50%. See Section 3.2 for background on belief formation and debate mechanics.

preferred rate drops to an average of 3.97%, and he dissents in 88% of simulations. Meanwhile, sim Musalem, sim Schmid, and sim Collins anchor their rates above 4.50%, pulling in the opposite direction. The final LLM-derived policy rate averages 4.375%. The MC benchmark under the same political pressure shows similar movement: the average final rate is 4.386%, but with nearly double the dispersion compared to the baseline. While the modal outcome remains at the upper bound (4.50%), the left tail becomes thicker: 33% of simulations end at 4.25%, and 5% drop to 4.00%. Dissent also becomes more common, occurring in 61% of meetings, with sim Waller almost always the culprit. Across both tracks, political pressure nudges the committee's center of gravity downward and erodes consensus, but without changing the standing rate range. These outcomes align with historical evidence suggesting that perceived threats to central bank independence often reshape expectations more than they alter the actual policy path (e.g., Bianchi et al., 2023).

Building on this, we introduce a second treatment: a negative labor market data revision, modeled after the August 1, 2025 Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) release. This scenario is layered on top of the political pressure context, allowing us to explore how the shocks compound. 7 The data revision enters as a real-time adjustment that lowers perceived payroll strength and raises uncertainty, especially for employment sensitive members. In the LLM track, this added shock produces a further drift downward, albeit small. The average final FFR falls to 4.30%, remaining within the 4.25%-4.50% range. Dissent, again driven entirely by sim Waller, rises to 73% of simulations. Relative to the baseline, this reflects a 12 basis point easing, consistent with a softer labor outlook, rather than a major policy regime shift. The MC track shows a similar downward nudge, with the mean final rate at 4.315% and a standard deviation of 15 basis points. The median remains at 4.25%, but dissent increases modestly, averaging 0.62 dissenters per meeting. Taken together, the layering of data uncertainty on top of political pressure illustrates how these shocks compound, and showcase how they can amplify disagreement, even within a constrained policy band.

models (e.g., Gerlach-Kristen, 2006; Riboni and Ruge-Murcia, 2010), we endogenize persuasion and career incentives by linking them to each member's information set. In standard models, influence is imposed exogenously by a chair or agenda setter; here, influence attempts and their costs arise organically during debate. Unlike Bayesian persuasion models (e.g., Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011), which feature one-to-many communication from a single informed sender, our environment allows many-to-many strategic exchanges, reflecting the interactive flow of arguments in actual FOMC meetings. Embedding reputation driven career concerns (Holmström, 1999) captures how members may adjust their positions to align with current or anticipated leaders. This creates a novel channel for political pressure on the Chair to spread: members reposition in anticipation of a leadership change, shifting the committee's stance before the change occurs. In sum, our model endogenizes both persuasion and career incentives, extending committee theory toward a more realistic representation of decision making.

Second, we link the rational choice committee model to behavioral research on cognitive biases, transparency, and communication in policy decisions. Prior work shows that policymakers' personal experiences can systematically shape their hawkish or dovish leanings: FOMC members who have lived through high inflation forecast higher inflation and favor tighter policy, whereas those with benign inflation histories lean dovish (Malmendier and Nagel, 2016). We embed this experience-based heterogeneity into our agent profiles, recognizing that members carry distinct biases and personal histories into deliberations. By integrating these behavioral factors into a formal voting model, we examine how cognitive biases and institutional features interact to shape policy outcomes.

Third, our work bridges two rapidly growing strands of computational economics: agent-based modeling with reinforcement learning for policy design (e.g., Peters et al., 2022; Cook and Palmer, 2025), and the use of large language model (LLM) agents to replicate realistic human interaction patterns (e.g., Manning et al., 2024). Recent studies have begun applying these methods to central banking; for instance, Seok et al. (2025) simulate deliberative exchanges among LLM agents in stylized monetary policy settings. Our framework differs in scope and design: we create

a dual-track environment where deliberative and rational voting behaviors run in parallel, grounded in real-time macroeconomic data and detailed FOMC member profiles.

More broadly, this simulation framework provides a controlled environment to stress test various scenarios. We can experiment in silico (Horton, 2023) with factors like disclosure rules, dissent penalties, or coalition dynamics to see how they affect decision making under various scenarios. By enabling counterfactual experimentation in a realistic setting, this framework lets policymakers and researchers explore various ' what if ' scenarios and observe the possible impacts on committee behavior and policy.

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. We review the FOMC meeting process in Section 2. We then outline our framework in Section 3, including the data collection, construction of agent personas, the multi-stage simulation design, as well as the voting process; Section 3.2 describes the game theory implementation and Section 3.3 describes the Monte Carlo simulation framework. Section 4 explores our counterfactual scenario and describes the results. Section 5 concludes with some policy implications.
