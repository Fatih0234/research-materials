## 3 LLM Simulation Framework

Standard models of committee voting assume members hold rational expectations, update beliefs via Bayes' rule, and vote to minimize well-defined loss functions. These assumptions yield testable predictions about voting patterns, dissent, and policy outcomes. Empirically, however, FOMC behavior diverges sharply from those forecasts. Between 1978 and 2023 fewer than 6% of all recorded ballots were dissents (Thornton and Wheelock, 2014), and from 2005 to 2022 not a single Board Governor dissented (Bobrov et al., 2025). Archival transcripts and insider accounts show that members undergo extensive staff briefings and private discussions in the week before each meeting, typically converging on the Chair's proposal well in advance

of the public vote (Bernanke, 2022). Dissent costs are also role-specific: Reserve Bank presidents, who face weaker career constraints, cast the vast majority of dissents, whereas D.C.-based Governors almost always vote with the Chair (Chappell and McGregor, 2013). Added to this are external pressures: political jaw-boning measurably impacts interest rate futures (Bianchi et al., 2023), while heightened transparency can induce conformity (Hughes and Fehrler, 2015). In short, premeeting coordination, consensus norms, career incentives, and political or market pressures all interact to influence the real-world outcomes away from the predictions of textbook voting models. Capturing these informal frictions is therefore central to any realistic simulation of FOMC decision-making.

LLMs enhance economic modeling in this context by integrating data, institutional rules, personal incentives, and strategic context in ways that mirror how Federal Reserve officials reason. And because LLMs converse naturally, they can explicitly model the information sharing, persuasion, and strategic positioning that turn individual views into collective monetary decisions. We model the FOMC meeting as a multi-agent system of twelve participants, comprising seven Governors and five Reserve Bank presidents. Each agent is an instance of an LLM endowed with a unique persona and a packet of economic data. The simulation pipeline (shown in Figure 1) unfolds in three sequential phases: (1) data input preparation, (2) formation of initial policy stance by each agent, and (3) full committee deliberation process and voting. We describe this pipeline next. 10
