## 3.1 Phase 3: Committee Deliberation and Voting

The deliberation stage replicates the procedural and behavioral dynamics of real FOMC meetings. Rather than modeling policy decisions in isolation, it simulates the full decision-making pipeline: information flow, informal pre-meeting coordination, structured debate moderated by the Chair, and institutional pressures that influence final votes. By capturing both informational inputs and member incentives, the system reflects how private priors, public reasoning, and consensus building interact to shape collective decisions.

Deliberation begins with the integration of all economic intelligence gathered earlier, including macro indicators, regional assessments, recent speeches, and the latest FOMC statement, along with each member's initial policy stance. Before formal debate, the system includes an optional consensus building phase, simulating the informal coordination typical of FOMC culture (Bernanke, 2022). 17

Once consensus building concludes, the system establishes the meeting context by presenting three key pieces of information. It begins by reviewing the results and decisions from the previous meeting to provide continuity in policy reasoning. It then

17 To model this, each agent's initial belief µ i, old is iteratively nudged toward a consensus target µ consensus , defined as a weighted average of the committee's median and mean beliefs:

where ω i = 0 . 15 × ( σ 2 i / 0 . 1) is a variance-dependent convergence rate that makes more uncertain members more susceptible to consensus pressure. Shared information in this stage also increases confidence by reducing each agent's variance through a confidence boost multiplier γ &lt; 1:

This ensures agents enter the formal meeting with more aligned beliefs and slightly higher conviction than their private priors.

extracts key language and forward guidance from the most recent FOMC statement, preserving institutional memory and highlighting any prior commitments. Finally, it presents an updated snapshot of current economic conditions, detailing changes in inflation, employment, growth, and regional dynamics since the last meeting.

The formal meeting simulation begins with the Chair opening the session, delivering an economic briefing, highlighting major developments, and posing the central policy question, i.e., whether to maintain the current federal funds rate or adjust it. Deliberation proceeds in structured rounds that mirror real FOMC debates. In the first round, selected members present policy recommendations with brief justifications based on their economic philosophy, regional context, and interpretation of current conditions. The second round shifts to a discussion moderated by the Chair, focused on the employment-inflation trade off, with dovish members emphasizing labor markets and hawkish members prioritizing price stability, both citing data. A third round enables direct engagement, as members challenge one another's arguments and refine their views. The Chair then concludes by summarizing key points, noting areas of consensus and disagreement, and proposing an agenda rate based on the discussion.

The decision phase then follows. The agenda rate is used as an anchor, and the final rate is calculated as a weighted average of the agenda rate (30%) and the committee median (70%). 18 Institutional pressure and dissent costs are applied, reflecting the dynamics of consensus seeking behavior within the FOMC. Members' institutional roles affect these dynamics: the Chair has strong agenda-setting power and very high dissent costs, while Governors have more independence. The dissent decision is modeled as a probabilistic rule tied to distance from the adopted rate, role-specific dissent costs, and each member's uncertainty. For member i , the dissent propensity is

18 Formally, the Fed Chair has one vote like any other FOMC voter. However, the Chair's influence is far greater than a 1/12 vote share due to control of procedure and communications. Prior empirical studies have found that during the Arthur Burns era (1970-78), for example, the FOMC Chair effectively carried 40-50% of the voting weight in policy decisions (Chappell Jr et al., 2004).

where µ i is the member's preferred rate, r final is the adopted rate, Var i is the member's belief variance, and κ i is a role-based dissent cost. In baseline settings,

with the Chair's cost reduced to 5 . 0 under political-pressure 'reduced authority.' A dissent is realized if:

Political pressure modifies κ i asymmetrically using appointment-likelihood weights: dovish dissent becomes cheaper and hawkish dissent more costly for high-likelihood candidates. The activation thresholds are relaxed for non-chair members with high appointment likelihood (effective cutoff lowered to 0 . 3 and minimum distance to 0 . 15 pp).
