## 3.2 Implementation Framework

We implement the Riboni and Ruge-Murcia (2010) framework with three key deviations for a more appropriate comparison against the LLM-based environment: (i) private signals are independent across members to model true heterogeneity 20 ; (ii) the Chair proposes the agenda via a fixed rule (median, mean, or status-quo) to isolate committee dynamics, rather than by optimizing their own loss 21 ; (iii) if a proposal

19 We calibrate the dissent indicator threshold τ in the rule p dissent = ∆(1 /κ ) (1 + σ )-with ∆ the absolute gap between a member's preferred rate and the final rate, κ the institutional dissent cost, and σ residual uncertainty, so that realized dissent frequencies align with the FOMC's historical range (about 5-15%), with τ = 0 . 5 landing around 8-10% in our baseline runs.

20 Riboni and Ruge-Murcia (2010) allow for correlated signals, whereas we assume independence. The rationale is pragmatic since correlation parameters are not separately identified in historical voting data, and heterogeneity at the FOMC is often driven by district specific, idiosyncratic information. Empirically, Chappell and McGregor (2013) show that cross-member forecast errors display weak correlation once common macro factors are removed. Independent signals therefore approximate the 'residual' heterogeneity relevant for persuasion.

21 Riboni and Ruge-Murcia (2010) model the Chair as minimizing her own loss. In practice the Fed Chair emphasizes consensus and signaling credibility more than personal utility. Transcripts reveal that Chairs routinely propose 'somewhere around the middle' of expressed views (see Bernanke, 2022). We therefore implement an institutional rule, r c = median { µ i } by default, and treat alternative rules (mean or status quo) as robustness cases. This choice converts the benchmark from a chair-dominance regime to a median voter regime, which is the modal empirical pattern

fails, the committee adopts the median of the ballots as a realistic compromise, not the previous-meeting rate. 22 These modifications retain the logic of Bayesian voting yet add empirically grounded institutional detail.

Each committee member i begins with a normal prior belief about the appropriate policy rate, r ∼ N ( µ 0 i , σ 0 2 i ). The agent then receives an independent private signal, s i , drawn from a distribution centered around their prior:

where σ 2 is the globally set signal noise. After receiving this signal, the agent forms a posterior belief N ( µ post i , σ post 2 i ) via the conjugate normal-normal updating rule. This posterior serves as the agent's initial belief entering the meeting phase.

The LLM simulation employs a consensus convergence mechanism that models realistic committee dynamics. During pre-meeting consensus building, beliefs evolve according to:

where ¯ µ t is the committee average belief, α i = 0 . 15 · ( σ 2 i,t / 0 . 1) captures convergence strength based on uncertainty, and variance reduces by 5% per round to model confidence building through information sharing. This mechanism captures the realistic tendency for committee members to converge toward consensus through informal coordination, rather than performing precise mathematical calculations.

The Chair applies a deterministic rule to the final set of posterior beliefs, { µ post i } ,

documented by Thornton and Wheelock (2014).

22 Historical minutes show that when the committee cannot agree on the Chair's proposal it typically negotiates a mid-point compromise rather than mechanically retaining the prior setting (e.g. the August 1989 and June 2003 meetings). This median fallback matches that practice and avoids artificially inflating policy inertia.

to generate the proposed agenda, r c :

The voting mechanism incorporates institutional pressures and role-based dissent costs. Member i faces a dissent cost C i that varies by institutional role, mirroring the LLM set up. The final rate reflects both agenda influence and committee preference through a weighted combination: r f = w a · r c + (1 -w a ) · median i µ post i , where w a = 0 . 3 under normal conditions and w a = 0 . 1 under political pressure, modeling reduced Chair authority. If the proposal fails in either implementation, the committee implements r f = median i b i , the median of all submitted ballots.
