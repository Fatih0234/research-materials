## 3.3 Monte Carlo Simulation

The Monte Carlo (MC) analysis implements the mathematical core of the Riboni and Ruge-Murcia (2010) framework with enhanced methodological features to enable rigorous statistical comparison with LLM simulation results. This approach abstracts away from natural language deliberation to focus on formal game theory mechanisms, allowing us to systematically vary institutional settings while maintaining strict comparability between simulation approaches.

Each MC draw represents a single realization of the voting game. The simulation begins with initial policy beliefs sourced from the LLM opinion formation stage. For each committee member i , their belief is represented as a normal distribution:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where µ i is the agent's preferred policy rate from LLM opinion formation and σ 2 i represents their baseline uncertainty derived from confidence levels. Belief means are

sampled from agents' own reported confidence distributions:

where the confidence-based variance is derived from self-reported confidence levels:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Here, c i ∈ [0 , 1] represents agent i 's confidence level and κ = 25 basis points is a calibration parameter ensuring that agents reporting 50% confidence have a standard deviation of κ .

Following belief initialization, each agent receives an independent private signal s i and updates their belief using conjugate normal-normal Bayesian updating:

where σ 2 signal represents the precision of private information. The simulation also includes a pre-meeting consensus-building phase designed to replicate institutional coordination mirroring the LLM simulation.

The Chair applies a deterministic rule to the post-consensus belief set { µ post i } to generate the agenda proposal:

The final agenda also incorporates Chair bias, if present: r c = r base +∆, where ∆

represents hawkish (∆ &gt; 0) or dovish (∆ &lt; 0) tendencies.

Institutional voting follows individual dissent cost calculations. Member i votes YES on proposal r c if:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where /epsilon1 = 0 . 25 percentage points represents the tolerance band and κ i captures member-specific dissent costs varying by institutional role and political conditions, calibrated to match LLM simulation patterns.

The proposal passes if the weighted vote share exceeds threshold ϑ = 0 . 5:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where standard voting weights are w i = 1 . 0 for all members. Failed proposals trigger implementation of the median submitted ballot: r f = median( { b i } ).

Each Monte Carlo draw records key variables for policy analysis: the Chair's proposed agenda rate ( r c ), the final implemented policy rate ( r f ), and the set of dissenting members ( D ). By running 10,000 draws, the Monte Carlo simulation provides statistical grounding for LLM results.
