## 4 Results

With these two simulation methods at hand, we now arrive at two complementary setups: a 'control' and a 'treatment.' In the control case, the Monte Carlo simulations depict a world of purely rational, rule-based agents. They receive initial beliefs, undergo a parameter change, and vote strictly according to predefined rules. This serves as the benchmark; what pure economic theory would predict under idealized conditions. The treatment, in contrast, introduces the LLM simulation, which reflects the messy and human-like dynamics of deliberation. Here, agents don't simply vote mechanically; they debate, argue, persuade, and react to one another. This layer of social interaction captures the complexity and unpredictability of real-world decision making.

In this section, we present the results of our primary counterfactual simulation.

Across all scenarios, the underlying economic environment, such as inflation, unemployment, and other key indicators, is held fixed at U.S. conditions in late July of 2025. This ensures that any differences in policy outcomes arise solely from changes in committee composition or decision-making rules, rather than from varying macroeconomic shocks.

However, to meaningfully evaluate the effects of political pressure, we must first understand the system's behavior in the absence of such distortions. We therefore begin with a baseline scenario, establishing a reference point under normal conditions.
