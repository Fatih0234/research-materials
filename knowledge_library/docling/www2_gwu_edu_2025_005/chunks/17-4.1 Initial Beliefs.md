## 4.1 Initial Beliefs

Table 3 summarizes the multi-iteration analysis ( ∼ 100 runs) of rate preferences, modeling high dimensional and complex belief formation. Confidence here is the agent's self-assessed certainty (percent) about its initial rate view. We transform this into the member's belief variance; higher confidence yields tighter distributions, which affects deliberation dynamics and posterior sampling in the MC mirror.

The results reveals distinct and persistent themes in the reasoning patterns of each FOMC member. On the dovish end of the spectrum, sim Kugler, sim Cook, and sim Goolsbee consistently emphasize the importance of supporting the labor market and sustaining the economic expansion in the face of gradually easing inflation. These members view monetary policy as a tool to ensure continued employment gains, and frequently cite the deceleration of inflationary pressures as justification for maintaining or even lowering interest rates. Their focus leans heavily toward protecting growth and minimizing the risks of premature tightening.

Simulated Powell, Williams, and Jefferson adopt a more balanced and flexible approach. These members consistently express a desire to remain data-dependent, neither aggressively tightening nor easing policy without clear justification. Their reasoning reflects a concern for maintaining economic stability, ensuring continued labor market strength, and watching closely for any resurgence of inflation. These policymakers tend to advocate for holding rates steady unless compelling evidence warrants a shift, favoring optionality and responsiveness to evolving macroeconomic conditions.

| sim Powell    | 4.44% (±0.080) | 84.8%        | Emphasizes balance of risks; data-driven neutral- ity amid persistent inflation and solid growth            |

| sim Schmid    | 4.58% (±0.117) | 84.9%        | Strongly hawkish; inflation pressures and robust growth warrant upper-bound positioning                     |
| sim Musalem   | 4.62% (±0.123) | 84.6%        | Focused on anchoring inflation expectations; prefers tighter policy to guard credibility                    |

Meanwhile, on the hawkish end of the committee, sim Schmid, sim Musalem, and sim Collins personas are more resolute in their call for tighter monetary policy. Their reasoning centers on the persistence of inflation and the need to anchor expectations through strong, pre-emptive rate stances. These members frequently point to robust consumer demand, strong labor market data, and signs of underlying inflation resilience as justification for maintaining elevated policy rates. They view any premature easing as a threat to the Fed's credibility and the longer term goal of price stability.

The most ideologically consistent voices emerge at the extremes. For example, sim Kugler persona, on the dovish side, and sim Schmid persona, on the hawkish side, exhibit the most stable reasoning across the 100 iterations, with minimal variation in their underlying justifications. Their positions are deeply anchored in their respective macroeconomic priorities: employment for sim Kugler, and inflation control sim Schmid. In contrast, sim Bowman shows a more variable perspective; sim Bowman is alert to inflation but, with mixed signals, her stance changes more than her peers'.
