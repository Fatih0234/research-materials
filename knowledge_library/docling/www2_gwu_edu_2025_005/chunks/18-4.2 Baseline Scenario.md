## 4.2 Baseline Scenario

The simulation begins with launching an LLM-driven meeting of the FOMC. The twelve autonomous agents representing the committee members are not blank slates; they enter with structured priors derived from current macroeconomic data. These agents are also governed by a set of institutional rules that mirror the culture of the real Federal Reserve. The synthetic FOMC members are deliberating against a backdrop of solid economic growth (GDP growth 3.0%), inflation above target, and a stable labor market (unemployment 4.1%, modest payroll growth). Table 8 summarizes the results:

The baseline distribution shows a modest hawkish tilt. sim Bowman is near the 4.50% upper bound (4.46%), while sim Collins (4.51%), sim Schmid (4.58%), and sim Musalem (4.62%) sit above it; sim Powell is just below at 4.44%. On the dovish side, sim Goolsbee, sim Cook, and sim Kugler are at 4.25%, with sim Jefferson (4.35%) and sim Barr (4.40%) slightly higher. The mean recommended rate is 4.40% (vs. a

Notes: In practice, the FOMC sets the target range for the federal funds rate in 25 basis point increments. The simulated Final FFR of 4.42% falls within the 4.25%-4.50% range, corresponding closer to the midpoint of the range (4.375%) than to the current effective FFR (4.33%) . Deliberation Rate: The interest rate each member publicly argues for during the formal meeting. Variation (Std): Standard deviation of the deliberation rate across 100 simulations. Uncertainty: Member's self-reported confidence/uncertainty (decimal form). Vote Bias: Difference between the deliberation rate and the simulated final FFR; positive = more hawkish, negative = more dovish.

simulated final FFR of 4.42%), and views span roughly 42 basis points. Notably, sim Waller is dovish in this simulation (4.20%).

In the simulated aggregation, the committee's Baseline FFR comes to 4.42%, which lies well within the prevailing 4.25%-4.50% target range. Given that the effective federal funds rate at the prior meeting was about 4.33%, this outcome implies an upward drift of roughly 9 basis points, effectively tightening policy within the existing range rather than formally raising it by a full 25 basis points.

Notes: Each row plots a kernel density estimate of that member's votes (densities normalized within row). Dashed references at 4.25% and 4.50%.

Despite the heterogeneity in beliefs, no formal dissents emerge. The Chair synthesizes prevailing inflation concerns with growth risks, presenting the upward shift as a balanced response that all members ultimately accept. This outcome illustrates how the simulation captures both diversity in individual preferences and the institutional dynamics that narrow disagreement and support consensus in FOMC deliberations.

Next, we summarize outcomes from the baseline Monte Carlo simulation. In the baseline scenario for July 31, 2025, across 10,000 simulated meetings, the final policy rate clusters around the prior 4.25-4.50% target range, with a mean of 4.376%, a standard deviation of 7.4 basis points, and outcomes spanning 4.19% to 4.68%. The distribution is centered slightly above the midpoint (4.33%), implying an average

upward drift of about 4-5 basis points in the effective federal funds rate. No formal dissents occur in any of the 10,000 runs, consistent with broad consensus.

Overall, both the LLM deliberation model and the Monte Carlo benchmark produce tightly clustered, consensus outcomes near the policy midpoint, but via different mechanisms. The LLM run offers a narrative of hawks and doves weighing conditions and converging on compromise. The Monte Carlo benchmark, relying only on institutional voting rules and members' initial proposals, reduces dispersion and yields no dissents across 10,000 runs. This alignment is consistent with (and supports the plausibility of) the LLM-derived outcomes.
