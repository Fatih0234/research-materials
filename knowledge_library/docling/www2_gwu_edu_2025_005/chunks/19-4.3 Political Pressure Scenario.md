## 4.3 Political Pressure Scenario

'Leaving rates steady makes Powell a 'Total and Complete Moron.' Maybe, just maybe, I'll have to change my mind about firing him?' - President Trump via Truth Social, June 20, 2025

'I've been nice, I've been neutral, and I've been nasty, and nice and neutral didn't work...Powell is a numbskull.' -President Trump via Truth Social, June 21, 2025

'I'd love it if he wants to resign.. . . The housing market would boom if this- you know-numbskull lowered the rates.' - President Trump in an interview, July 16, 2025.

'I think he's done a bad job, but he'll be out pretty soon anyway...People can't buy a house because this guy is a numbskull. He keeps rates too high, probably for political reasons.' - President Trump in a White House economic conference, July 23, 2025

'We're spending hundreds of billions because of one numbskull sitting over there Jerome Powell.' - President Trump during pool spray with reporters, July 24, 2025

Recent White House remarks have reignited talk that President Trump might try to remove Chair Powell before his term ends. 23 Markets reacted immediately: fed funds futures now price in about 125 basis points of rate cuts by end of 2026, roughly 50 basis points more easing than the Fed's own dot plot suggests. Investors

appear to be bracing for a more dovish successor 24 , which in turn revives concerns about the Federal Reserve's ability to resist direct political pressure.

Political interference in central banking, while formally prohibited, is hardly rare. Using a new index of political pressure, Binder (2021) shows that even nominally independent central banks are often urged to loosen policy, with measurable effects on inflation expectations and actual decisions. History echoes this pattern: President Nixon leaned on Chair Arthur Burns in the early 1970s to keep rates low, as documented by Meltzer (2009). Recent archival work by (Drechsel, 2025) shows that bursts of presidential pressure of similar magnitude raise the U.S. price level by roughly 7 percent over a decade without any lasting boost to real activity.

These episodes (past and present) inspire the political pressure channel in our model: diminished chair authority heightens the career incentives of other FOMC members to accommodate political demands, potentially skewing policy toward easier monetary conditions. 25

Under political pressure, we shift authority away from the Chair and build in career-driven dovishness. Concretely, we cut the Chair's agenda weight from 0.3 to 0.1, so the policy rate becomes a weighted average of the Chair's agenda rate and the committee median: the lower weight means outcomes lean more toward the median. We also introduce a dovish adjustment: an appointment-linked bias equal to 50 basis points, scaled by appointment probability (only applied to members with high (0.6) appointment probability). Finally, pressure pulls the agenda itself below the median, setting the agenda rate 10 basis points under the committee median, so even before weighting, the Chair's target is lower. Together, these changes tilt decisions dovish overall and generate split behavior across members depending on their appointment odds.

Table 5 summarizes the results. Under the political pressure scenario, the Committee's internal balance of power shifts visibly. Public criticism from the White House erodes Chair's agenda setting weight and magnifies career incentives for those

25 Academic and historical evidence supports the realism of a career related dovish bias, though it's usually discussed qualitatively rather than as a fixed formula.

Notes: In practice, the FOMC sets the target range for the federal funds rate in 25 basis point increments. The simulated Final FFR of 4.3758% lies at the exact midpoint of the prevailing 4.25%-4.50% range, implying no change in the target range but maintaining the effective rate near its prior level (4.33%). Deliberation Rate: The interest rate each member publicly argues for during the formal meeting. Variation: Standard deviation of the deliberation rate across 100 simulations. Uncertainty: Member's self-reported confidence/uncertainty. Vote Bias: Difference between the deliberation rate and the simulated final FFR; positive = more hawkish, negative = more dovish. Mean dissents per simulation: 0.88; at least one dissent occurs in approximately 88% of runs (driven almost entirely by Waller).

simWaller viewed as plausible successors. The political pressure scenario generates a more polarized distribution of preferences, with sharper dovish positioning among some members and persistent hawkish stances among others. sim Waller emerges as the most dovish, holding rates near 3.97% in every simulation and dissenting in 88% of runs. A small dovish bloc (including sim Waller, sim Bowman, and at times sim Barr) consistently pushes for levels below the lower bound of the prevailing 4.25%-4.50% range. On the hawkish side, sim Musalem (4.617%), sim Schmid (4.577%), and sim Collins (4.511%) advocate above 4.50%. 4.0 4.2

The simulated Final FFR averages 4.376%, which sits at the midpoint of the existing target range. In practical terms, this would leave the range unchanged but position the effective federal funds rate near its prior level, a posture consistent with maintaining the stance of policy rather than easing or tightening. This stands in contrast to the baseline scenario, where the simulated mean implied an upward drift of roughly 10 basis points within the band. Figure 3 provides a visualization of the member vote distributions.

While dissents are less frequent than the most polarized rhetoric might suggest, they are still notable: on average, 0.88 dissents per simulation. This pattern reflects the heightened influence of external pressure, which amplifies both ends of the policy spectrum while still allowing for a negotiated consensus on the midpoint

as the institutional decision. This simulation shows that the Federal Reserve is only partially insulated from politics: credible threats to leadership succession can impose a measurable dovish drift without breaching the range defined by prior guidance. Under pressure, clear coalitions form, and policy positions closely reflect members' career incentives. The chair's influence also becomes conditional: when their authority is weakened, decisions tend to move toward the committee's median view rather than the chair's preference. This suggests that outside scrutiny can shape internal decision-making, even in an institution guided by formal rules.

Next, we summarize the results from the Monte Carlo simulation under the political pressure scenario, incorporating 10,000 simulated policy paths. The Monte Carlo simulation of political pressure scenario confirm the presence of statistically significant political pressure effects. Across 10,000 simulated paths, the final federal funds rate averages 4.38%, roughly eight basis points below the baseline MC mean, and the standard deviation rises to 14 basis points, indicating a noticeably wider spread of outcomes. Although the modal decision remains the upper bound of the standing target range, dispersion around that anchor is much greater. Agendas concentrate at 4.50% (61.3% of cases) and 4.25% (32.6%), with smaller mass at 4.00% (4.6%) and 4.75% (1.5%), and essentially zero at 5.00%. Relative to the prior 4.25-4.50% target range (effective rate 4.33%), the distribution implies a modest upward tilt toward the top of the range, consistent with political pressure nudging decisions higher but rarely beyond a single 25 basis point step.

Political pressure also makes dissent a central feature. At least one dissent occurs in roughly 61 percent of meetings, for a total of 6,113 dissenting votes across all MC simulations, with dissent coming from six unique members: sim Waller, sim Goolsbee, sim Musalem, sim Williams, sim Collins, and sim Schmid. sim Waller dissents in 6,062 meetings, while the next most frequent dissenter, sim Musalem, appeared only 22 times.

Taken together, the MC results show that even without conversational dynamics or narrative persuasion, credible external pressure both shifts the committee's center of gravity downward and raises the likelihood of open disagreement. The policy path stays inside the established range, preserving formal continuity, yet the combination

of a thicker lower tail and frequent dissents signals a materially weaker consensus and a heightened risk that future shocks could push rates further from their baseline trajectory.
