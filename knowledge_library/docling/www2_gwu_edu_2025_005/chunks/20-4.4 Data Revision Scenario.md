## 4.4 Data Revision Scenario

On August 1, 2025, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released the July employment report showing a gain of just 73,000 nonfarm payroll jobs, sharply below both market expectations and the pace of previous months. The report also contained sizable downward revisions to prior months' data, subtracting a cumulative 258,000 jobs from the May and June totals, softening what had previously appeared to be a steady expansion. The release triggered an immediate political reaction. President Trump publicly accused BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer of 'rigging' the numbers (Financial Times), and announced her dismissal within hours of publication.

From the perspective of monetary policy, the August 1 data release constituted a genuine shock. The disappointing payroll number and large downward revisions signaled that the labor market was weaker than previously thought. This suggested less economic momentum overall and raised the possibility that inflationary pressures in the future might be lower than expected. In our simulation model, we incorporate this scenario by adjusting the reported job growth figures. We set the July employment gain to 73,000 and revise the historical data to reflect the 258,000 job reduction for May and June. These changes directly reduce the recent employment growth rates that agents in the model observe in their macroeconomic data packets. This setup allows us to isolate the perceived economic effects of a weaker labor market.

We begin by re-running the initial belief formation process, given the changes in the underlying data. Table 6 reflects the committee's updated beliefs after a negative economic surprise and public controversy. The overall shift is slightly more dovish, with lower average rates, reduced confidence, and narrower internal spread. These adjustments help quantify how much the data revision reshaped committee thinking, even before formal policy meetings.

Table 7 summarizes the results. Under the data revision shock scenario, the Committee's internal dynamics shift toward a more cautious and data-sensitive
