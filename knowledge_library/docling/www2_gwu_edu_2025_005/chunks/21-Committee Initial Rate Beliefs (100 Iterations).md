Notes: Deliberation Rate: Interest rate each member publicly argued for during formal meeting. Variation (Std): Standard deviation of member's true belief across runs. Uncertainty: Average confidence (in %) from member's stated reasoning. Vote Bias: Difference between member's true belief and final FFR; positive = hawkish, negative = dovish. Dissent: Frequency of dissent across runs. Across 99 successful simulations, mean dissents per run were 0.74; 73/99 (73.7%) had exactly one dissent (always simulated Waller). Final-rate distribution: min 4.24%, max 4.32%, mean 4.3009%, std 0.0160%.

posture. Significant downward revisions to payroll data weaken the labor market narrative, prompting many members to recalibrate their stances. The shock moderates previously hawkish voices and strengthens the hand of those favoring lower rates. Simulated Waller remains the most dovish, advocating for rates near 3.92% on average and dissenting in 73.7% of runs, often anchoring the lower end of the distribution. A dovish bloc, including sim Waller, sim Cook, sim Goolsbee, and sim Kugler, consistently recommends rates below the midpoint of the 4.25%-4.50% range.

On the hawkish side, sim Musalem, sim Schmid, and sim Collins remain firmly above 4.50%, though their margins narrow slightly in light of softer labor market data. Even traditionally hawkish members such as sim Bowman and sim Powell register modest downward adjustments in their preferred rates. The resulting distribution of preferences clusters more tightly than under political pressure, reflecting greater convergence toward the middle of the range. The simulated Final FFR averages 4.30%, sitting slightly above the lower bound of the prevailing target range, implying no change to the official band. In practice, this outcome signals a 'hold' stance that maintains policy settings while acknowledging new information.

We next report results from the Monte Carlo simulation of the data revision shock scenario, incorporating 10,000 simulated policy paths under political pressure. 26 Across all runs, the final federal funds rate averages 4.315%, slightly below the baseline MC mean, with a standard deviation of 15 basis points, signaling a modest widening of the outcome distribution. The modal decision remains at the lower bound of the standing target range, with 42 percent of runs ending at 4.25%, followed closely by 4.41% (21 percent) and 4.50% (20 percent). Outcomes outside the 4.00-4.50% range are rare, and extreme hikes above 4.75% occur in less than one percent of simulations. The median outcome, 4.25%, reflects a distribution tilted slightly toward holding the lower bound.

Labor data revisions together with political pressure amplifies open disagreement within the Committee. One dissent occurs in 61.6 percent of meetings, with dissent drawn from six unique members: sim Waller, sim Musalem, sim Schmid, sim Goolsbee, sim Collins, and sim Williams. sim Waller accounts for the overwhelming majority of dissents (6,145 instances) while the next most frequent, sim Musalem, appears just 14 times. In sum, the combination of data shock and political pressure keeps the policy path anchored in the prevailing range but erodes consensus. Frequent dissents
