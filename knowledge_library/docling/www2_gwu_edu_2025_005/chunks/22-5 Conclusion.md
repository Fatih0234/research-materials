## 5 Conclusion

This paper introduces a dual-track framework that measures how deliberation and institutional frictions move committee outcomes relative to a rational benchmark using the same information set. We run an LLM-based committee deliberation in parallel with a generalized Bayesian voting model and compare final policy rates and dissent. Three facts emerge. First, the 'behavioral wedge' of policy deliberations is small but systematic: in our July-2025 baseline the LLM track yields a final rate of 4.42% vs 4.38% in Monte Carlo. Under political pressure settings, the mean decision shifts modestly down, dissent becomes common (LLM 88% of meetings; MC 62%), and the modal outcome stays inside the 4.25-4.50% band. When political pressure rises or the Chair's authority is questioned, the center of policy usually stays within the existing range, but disagreement becomes the story: dissents jump and cohesion erodes. Third, when labor data are revised down, the final rate falls further, again without band changes but with elevated dissent.

Our dual-track framework offers a tool for tracing how institutional procedures and strategic interactions shape policy. The framework allows to isolate behavioral inflection points: when coalitions form, when dissent emerges, and when reputational incentives override private beliefs. In doing so, it enables a new generation of policy experimentation where central banks can stress test governance rules in silico before applying them in the real world.

While this version simulates a single policy meeting with static economic inputs, the framework is extensible. Future iterations could incorporate multi-period dynamics, persistent shocks, learning, and expectation formation across time. In sum, this framework allows policymakers to rehearse decisions, explore vulnerabilities, and evaluate reforms before they are tested in crisis.
