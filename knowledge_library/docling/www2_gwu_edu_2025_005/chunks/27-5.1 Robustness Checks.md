## 5.1 Robustness Checks

Here, we present the results for data revision shock (without the political pressure treatment). In the LLM track, dovish members who prioritize employment become more uncertain when labor market conditions appear weaker. Deliberation transcripts show this as either caution in interpreting the revision or skepticism about its durability. The Chair's instructions include a nudge about the labor data revisions. 27

Notes: In practice, the FOMC sets the target range for the federal funds rate in 25 basis point increments. The simulated Final FFR of 4.3292% falls within the 4.25%-4.50% range, corresponding to an effective rate near the midpoint (4.33%). Deliberation Rate: The interest rate each member publicly argues for during the formal meeting. Variation (Std): Standard deviation of the deliberation rate across 100 simulations. Uncertainty: Member's self-reported confidence/uncertainty (decimal form). Vote Bias: Difference between the deliberation rate and the simulated final FFR; positive = more hawkish, negative = more dovish.

Comparing these results to the baseline simulation, the labor data shock scenario produces a modest but measurable dovish drift in the committee's stance. The simulated final FFR declines from 4.420% in the baseline to 4.329%, an 9 basis point reduction, while remaining within the same 4.25%-4.50% target range. This shift reflects the Chair's slightly more dovish opening proposal and the increased weight given to the median committee signal during synthesis.

The largest effects are concentrated among employment-focused members. sim Goolsbee, sim Cook, and sim Kugler each maintain their baseline deliberation rates but show no hawkish shift, while their uncertainty remains elevated, making them marginally more inclined toward rate holds or cuts in close call scenarios. Notably, these members' vote biases stay dovish at 0.1704, but without the upward drift in rates observed in the baseline when labor momentum is perceived as stronger. Hawkish members, including sim Schmid and sim Musalem, retain higher deliberation rates but edge down slightly from their baseline positions (-8 and -11 basis points, respectively), narrowing the gap with the committee median. Variation across simulations remains essentially unchanged, indicating that the dovish shift stems more from central tendency adjustments than from increased dispersion.

27 NOTE: Labor data revision shows weaker payroll momentum; prior months overestimated. Treat labor as softer.

In sum, the scenario moves the committee toward a slightly lower and more consensus oriented outcome, softening the influence of more hawkish voices and reinforcing the weight of the median when the labor market is seen as weaker and data credibility is questioned.

In the Monte Carlo track, the labor market shock enters as a downward adjustment to the employment gap parameter in the initial belief formation stage, with a concurrent increase in posterior variance for employment-sensitive members. Inflation expectations and other inputs are held constant to isolate the labor data effect. Voting then proceeds under the usual Bayesian updating and institutional rules.

Comparing the data revision shock to the baseline MC simulation, the mean final rate declines from 4.376% to 4.321%, a reduction of roughly 5.5 basis points on a continuous scale. While both scenarios keep outcomes firmly within the existing 4.25%-4.50% target range (effective rate 4.33%), the shock tilts the distribution modestly downward, placing the mean just below the midpoint rather than slightly above it.

The agenda rate shows a larger adjustment, falling from 4.377% in the baseline to 4.297% under the shock, suggesting that the initial proposals entering deliberation are already shaped by weaker labor market assessments. This leaves less upward room for subsequent negotiation, and the Chair's moderation narrows the spread from proposal to final decision.

Dispersion in final rates remains virtually unchanged (0.074 vs. 0.075), and the absence of dissents in both cases underscores the strong central consensus despite the shock. The minimum and maximum simulated outcomes shift downward by similar magnitudes (about 13-15 basis points) reflecting a uniform leftward shift in the simulated rate distribution rather than a widening of tails. Overall, the Monte Carlo framework yields a slightly more dovish and consensus-driven outcome under the data revision shock, with lower agenda anchors feeding directly into marginally lower final rates.
