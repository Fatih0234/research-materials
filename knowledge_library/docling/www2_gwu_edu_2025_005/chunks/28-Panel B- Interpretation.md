## Panel B: Interpretation

Final rates cluster within the 4.25-4.50% target range in place before the meeting (effective federal funds rate 4.33%). The mean of 4.321% lies one basis point from the midpoint, implying a modest downward tilt when viewed on a continuous scale. In actual policy terms, this corresponds to holding the rate steady, with no formal dissents recorded. The Chair's moderation narrows variability from agenda to final decision.
