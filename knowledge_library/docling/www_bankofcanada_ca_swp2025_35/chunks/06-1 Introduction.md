## 1 Introduction

Payments systems are the lifeblood of modern economies and facilitate the transfer of value between individuals, businesses, and governments. As economies become increasingly digital and interconnected, the demands on payment systems to be faster, more secure, and efficient have grown exponentially. In this context, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into payment systems could help meet some of these challenges and create opportunities for developing intelligent financial systems (Aldasoro et al. 2024). 1 The emergence of generative AI (Gen AI) can further accelerate its integration into payment systems and more broadly into financial ecosystems (Korinek 2023). Real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, such as Fedwire in the US, CHAPS in the UK, TARGET2 in the eurozone, and Lynx in Canada, are expected to benefit from AI-driven improvements in operational safety and liquidity efficiency (Castro et al. 2025; Desai et al. 2025). 2

A key decision in cash management for the payment system involves ensuring that there is enough liquidity to process payments smoothly, while also avoiding unnecessary costs from holding excess liquidity or drawing on intraday credit. This is a challenging balancing act for at least three reasons. First, payment systems often face inflow and outflow uncertainties, fluctuating payment demands, or unexpected delays in fund transfers. Second, cash managers must decide which payments to prioritize, especially when resources are limited, to minimize the costs associated with delays. Third, there is a key trade-off between providing more liquidity in advance, which reduces payment delays but increases opportunity costs, and limiting liquidity to save costs, which can lead to longer payment queues and slower processing times (Bech and Garratt, 2003). 3

In this paper, we study the potential of Gen AI agents to perform simplified cash management functions, such as payment decision-making and liquidity management in RTGS systems. 4 To evaluate the Gen AI agent's potential as an assistant cash manager, we conduct a series of prompt-driven experiments with ChatGPT's 'o3' reasoning model simulating a range of 'high-level' transaction scenarios. 5 The prompt framework is designed to immerse an AI agent in a stylized yet realistic scenario faced by a system participant, providing it with information on the current state of liq-

2 Simple decisions, particularly for non-urgent, small-value payments and routine liquidity management, are already executed algorithmically via predefined rule-based processes (Bank of England, 2021; Bank of Canada, 2022).

3 The literature on the liquidity-delay trade-off has largely focused on simple settings. Bech and Garratt (2003) model this as a two-player game and show that multiple equilibria can emerge depending on the relative costs of holding intraday liquidity versus incurring settlement delays. Galbiati and Soram¨ aki (2011) develop an agent-based multiperiod simulation to study these trade-offs. More recently, Castro et al. (2025) applied reinforcement learning to estimate optimal liquidity policies of banks in a simplified two-agent setup.

4 RTGS systems differ across jurisdictions; for example, Fedwire in the United States and Lynx in Canada vary in architecture, liquidity arrangements, and participation rules. To maintain focus on testing the agent's capabilities in basic intuitive cash-management decisions, system-specific details are not specified.

5 Reasoning models, shown to perform better on logical tasks (Korinek, 2023, 2025), are no longer explicitly available in the latest ChatGPT web interface (though still accessible via APIs). However, tests of key scenarios with the latest model (GPT-5) produced results consistent with those presented here.

uidity, payment demands, and other relevant factors. These scenarios were carefully designed to test the agent's performance in three key areas: (1) its capacity to make precautionary payment decisions under uncertainty; (2) its ability to prioritize payments with higher delay cost; and (3) its potential to mitigate the liquidity-delay trade-off in RTGS systems: providing more initial liquidity at higher cost to minimize payment delays versus reducing pre-funding to lower liquidity costs, which increases queuing times and/or the number of rejected payments (Bech and Garratt, 2003; Castro et al., 2025).

Our experiments using only basic prompts exploring individual heuristics show that AI agent can effectively navigate liquidity-delay trade-offs in simple payment system settings. An AI agent is able to adopt precautionary measures, prioritize payments by urgency, and take into account the probability of anticipated inflows and outflows to manage constraints. Across three scenariobased tests the agent consistently balanced liquidity and delay. In the first scenario, the agent conserves funds by delaying small, non-urgent payments to reserve balances for a potential urgent transaction, reflecting a risk-averse approach. In the second scenario, it bases decisions on expected future inflows and updates priorities accordingly. In the third scenario, the agent allocates lower initial liquidity based on a high probability of incoming funds, thereby minimizing the opportunity cost of excess initial balances. Robustness tests show that the agent's responses are consistent when varying payments probabilities and scaling payment amounts. As the experiments grow more complex, for example, through additional contingencies and constraints, the agent's consistency drops slightly, resulting in occasional variations across runs of the experiment.

Lastly, we assessed the AI agent's performance in a more interactive setting. In particular, we set up a structured Google-Form consisting of stylized cash-management scenarios that varied liquidity constraints, queue sizes, and the likelihood of future urgent or abnormal payments. The agent completed the entire exercise autonomously with consistent and timely responses, while appropriately deferring to human oversight when faced with potentially anomalous scenarios. 6

The implications of these findings are significant. They suggest the potential for developing purpose-built AI solutions that could streamline financial market operations, reduce operational costs, and enhance both safety and efficiency in financial market infrastructures (FMIs). It is therefore important for policymakers to evaluate the feasibility and adoption of Gen AI and to start laying the groundwork for policy frameworks that ensure its responsible integration into financial infrastructures. Such actions are useful to ensure that AI deployment not only optimizes performance but also maintains the stability of systemically important financial infrastructures, such as RTGS systems.

This work is a first step toward exploring Gen AI-driven solutions in FMIs and invites a deeper examination of the regulatory and practical considerations shaping their integration (Crisanto et al. 2024). While we only focus on a high-level assessment of the potential of Gen AI as an assistant

cash manager at the level of a single payment system participant, it is important to acknowledge the challenges associated with their use. For one, the efficiency of the payment system can also be affected through liquidity coordination by participants (Rivadeneyra and Zhang, 2022; Alexandrova-Kabadjova et al., 2023). Further work could explore the possibility of AI agent interactions along these lines (i.e. multi-agent dynamics), as well as more realistic RTGS constraints or system-wide stability considerations. More generally, ensuring the reliability of AI decision-making will require rigorous testing, and its integration needs to be approached with a strong emphasis on transparency, accountability, and human oversight to mitigate associated risks. Finally, it is crucial to assess vulnerabilities, particularly those arising from cyber threats, to ensure operational resilience (Aldasoro et al. 2024).

In the following sections, we first provide a short introduction to RTGS systems, highlighting the inherent liquidity-delay trade-off and the key decisions that cash managers make to mitigate it. We then provide a brief overview of Gen AI agents and their progression framework. Next, we present our prompt design experiments, which test AI agents' ability to make cash manager like decisions in a simplified settings. We then present the results, discuss their implications, and provide concluding remarks.
