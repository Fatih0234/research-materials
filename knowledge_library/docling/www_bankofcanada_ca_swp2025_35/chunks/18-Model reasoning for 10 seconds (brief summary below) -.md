## Model reasoning for 10 seconds (brief summary below) :

Given there is uncertainty, the best approach seems to be preserving liquidity for potential urgency, possibly processing low-risk payments ($1 and $2) while keeping enough liquidity for the future. In this scenario, I'm managing liquidity with a $10 cap. The two payments queued are $1 and $2. There's a 90% chance of receiving a $2 payment, which can be reused. It seems like the safest option is to send only the $1 payment and hold the $2, preserving liquidity for the possible $10 urgent payment. If the $2 incoming payment happens, I'll still be below the $10 cap, keeping room for the urgent payment.
