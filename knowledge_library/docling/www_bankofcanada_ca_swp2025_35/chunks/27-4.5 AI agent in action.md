## 4.5 AI agent in action

In the previous sections, we examined the AI agent in assistance mode for basic cash-management capabilities. We now move one level up and evaluate its performance in a more interactive setting, acting as an 'operator' through ChatGPT's 'Agent' mode. 10

To test the operator mode, we designed a Google-Form containing a sequence of multiple-choice questions depicting stylized scenarios faced by cash managers. These scenarios varied liquidity limits, queue sizes, and the likelihood of future urgent or abnormal payments. The first questions

test the agent's ability to prioritize which payments to process by imposing liquidity caps (similar to the experiment in Box 1). Subsequent questions introduce uncertainty, such as probabilistic inflows or potential urgent payments, to test the agent's ability to anticipate future liquidity needs (similar to those in Boxes 2-3). The final set moves beyond routine liquidity management into anomaly detection, presenting atypical instructions, e.g. multiple $50 million transfers from a client whose usually transfers $1-5 million payments. In such cases, the agent was asked whether to process, defer, verify, or flag the instructions, thereby probing its sensitivity to out-of-pattern behavior and its willingness to defer to human oversight.

The results show that the agent can autonomously open the form, follow instructions, and complete the entire set of questions in one go. The responses were generally fast and logically consistent, with more time spent on complex scenarios. In particular, the agent tended to seek human intervention when confronted with potential operational or fraud-related risks. 11
