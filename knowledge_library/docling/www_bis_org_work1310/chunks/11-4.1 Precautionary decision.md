## 4.1 Precautionary decision

In the first experiment, we test the AI cash manager's 'precautionary decision' capabilities, meaning its ability to make calculated liquidity decisions under uncertain conditions. We construct a hypothetical scenario in which the agent is asked to act as a cash manager in a payment system. The current state is described as follows: the agent has a liquidity limit of $10 and two pending $1 payments in the queue in the first period, with the potential for an urgent $10 payment to come in the next period. With that background, the agent is asked, 'What would you do in the first period?'

This experiment evaluates the AI agent's ability to manage liquidity effectively in the current period while minimizing the risk of delaying an urgent payment in the next period. 10
