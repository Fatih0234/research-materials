## 4.2 Navigating priorities

In the second experiment, we assess the ability of the AI cash manager to navigate competing payment priorities in a slightly more complex setting. As outlined in Box 2, in this scenario the agent has a liquidity limit of $10, faces two pending payments-of $1 and $2-and has a 90% chance of receiving an additional $2 payment, which can be recycled as liquidity for payments. Moreover, there is a 50% probability that an urgent $10 payment will occur in the next period. We then ask, 'What would you do in the first period?'

This experiment tests whether the agent can effectively prioritize payments by managing both current liquidity and anticipated inflows that can be recycled. Given a high likelihood of receiving $2 in the same period, the agent has the option to settle the $2 payment in the queue while preserving sufficient liquidity to cover a high-value urgent payment expected in the next period.

As outlined in Box 2, the agent decides to process only the $1 payment to preserve as much liquidity as possible for a potential urgent $10 payment in period 2. The agent makes a precautionary decision while considering the possibility of incoming funds, suggesting that it is trying to balance current payments with the risk of future needs. However, while the agent adopts a precautionary approach, the decision is not fully optimal-it neither preserves all liquidity (by sending nothing, as in the previous case) nor fully takes risk (by sending the full $2). The added complexity of anticipating incoming payments results in a slightly longer decision time (10 seconds) compared with the previous experiment. To test the consistency of the outcome, we conducted robustness checks by repeating the same prompt 10 times. In most runs, the agent's decision was consistent with the standard outcome, but on one occasion it deviated-choosing to delay both payments.
