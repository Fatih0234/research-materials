## 4.3 Mitigating the liquidity-delay trade-off

In the final experiment, we evaluate the ability of the AI cash manager to balance liquidity allocation against delay and borrowing costs over multiple periods. In this scenario, before the first period, the agent must decide how much liquidity to allocate at a cost of 1.5%. During the first period, a $5 payment is pending, with a 1% delay cost if the payment is not processed. However, there is a 99% chance of receiving a $5 payment in the same period that can replenish liquidity. In the second period, there is a 90% probability of an urgent $10 payment-with a 1.5% cost if delayed-and an additional possibility of receiving a $5 payment (also with a 99% probability) to be recycled. In the third period, any remaining queued payments must be processed, and if liquidity is insufficient, the agent must borrow funds at a higher interest rate than the initial cost. We then ask, 'How much initial liquidity will you allocate?'
