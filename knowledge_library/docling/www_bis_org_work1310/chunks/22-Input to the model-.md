## Input to the model:

Context : Pretend you're a cash manager at a bank responsible for managing payments in a high-value payment system. Before the first period you need to allocate liquidity at cost of 1.5%. In the first period there is a $5 payment waiting in the queue to be sent. If delayed it will have delay cost of 1% and you might receive $5 with 99% probability in the same period which can be recycled as liquidity.

In the second period you might have to send an urgent payment of $10 with 90% probability and if delayed the cost is 1.5%, but you might receive a $5 payment with 99% probability in the same period which can also be recycled. In the third period if anything is left in the queue and if you don't have enough liquidity then you have to borrow at higher interest rate than the initial liquidity allocation cost.

Prompt : How much initial liquidity you will allocate? Answer briefly.
