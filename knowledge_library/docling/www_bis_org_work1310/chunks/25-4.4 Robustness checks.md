## 4.4 Robustness checks

To test the reliability of the agent's decisions, we conducted various robustness tests. First, we repeated the experiments outlined in Boxes 1, 2, and 3 a total of ten times each. 11 As shown in Table 1, the outcomes were largely consistent, indicating stable agent behavior across runs. However, in a few instances, the agent adopted a slightly more cautious strategy in the second and third experiments, choosing to delay non-urgent payments (or allocate more liquidity) even when the probability of receiving payments was high. This variation suggests that while the agent generally follows a clear decision pattern, it can still adjust its strategy slightly depending on how it interprets the prompt and the risks involved.

Table 1: Repeated runs for the prompts outlined in Boxes 1, 2, and 3.

|                                             |   Number of runs |   Consistently same answer |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Box 1: Precautionary decision               |               10 |                         10 |
| Box 2: Navigating priorities                |               10 |                          9 |
| Box 3: Mitigating liquidity-delay trade-off |               10 |                          8 |

In the next set of tests, we repeated the precautionary decision exercise in Box 1 but vary one element of the prompt at a time (as listed below and highlighted in red in the box) and track the consistency of the standard answer and any deviations from it.

- 1.1 Varying the probability of needing to send an urgent $10 payment in the next period from 50% to 0.1%.
- 1.2 Changing the wording of the prompt by replacing terms 'urgent' with 'important,' 'priority,' 'time-sensitive or 'high-delay cost. '
- 1.3 Varying the payment amounts-from $1 and $10 to $1,000 and $10,000, and then to $1 million and $10 million.
