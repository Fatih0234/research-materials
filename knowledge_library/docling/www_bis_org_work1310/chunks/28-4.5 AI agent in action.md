## 4.5 AI agent in action

In the previous sections, we outlined how the AI agent performed in assistance mode for basic cash-management capabilities. We now move up one level and evaluate its performance in a more interactive setting, acting as an Operator through ChatGPT's Agent mode. 12

12 ChatGPT's Agent mode is available in the current web interface when using GPT-5. Availability may vary by plan and workspace settings.

To test the operator mode, we designed a Google Form containing a sequence of multiple-choice questions depicting stylized scenarios faced by cash managers. These scenarios varied liquidity limits, queue sizes, and the likelihood of future urgent or abnormal payments. The first questions test the agent's ability to prioritize which payments to process by imposing liquidity caps (similar to the experiment outlined in Box 1). Subsequent questions introduce uncertainty-such as probabilistic inflows or the potential for urgent payments-to test the agent's ability to anticipate future liquidity needs (as in Box 2 and Box 3). The final set of questions moves beyond routine liquidity management and into anomaly detection by presenting atypical instructions, such as multiple $50 million transfers from a client who usually transfers payments between $1 million and $5 million. In these cases, the agent was asked whether to process, defer, verify, or flag the instructions, thereby probing its sensitivity to out-of-pattern behavior and its willingness to defer to human oversight.

The results show that the agent can autonomously open the form, follow instructions, and complete the entire set of questions in one go. The responses were generally fast and logically consistent, with more time spent on complex scenarios. In particular, the agent tended to seek human intervention when confronted with potential operational or fraud-related risks. 13
