## 7 Conclusion and next steps

This paper provides a high-level evaluation of the potential for a Gen AI agent to act as a cash manager in payment systems. Our experiments suggest that even a general purpose AI model can automate simple payment and liquidity management choices: the agent can make precautionary decisions, prioritize payments under uncertainty, and effectively manage liquidity-delay trade-offs. Therefore, financial institutions could adopt purpose-built AI solutions to reduce operational costs while improving efficiency with a human in the loop. In parallel, the broader theoretical and regulatory implications underscore the need for careful implementation. Policymakers and financial institutions can consider these findings as they explore further integration of AI into critical financial systems, with a focus on detailed risk assessment and regulatory compliance.

Future research should expand on these experiments, explore additional scenarios, and refine the practical guidelines necessary for safe and responsible deployment. Moreover, our setup using agentic AI-powered by LLMs-may offer a more efficient and flexible alternative to traditional RL approaches like those in Castro et al. (2025). Training RL agents is akin to teaching a child about payments from scratch; it requires extensive simulations and time to learn optimal strategies. In contrast, through zero-shot or few-shot learning capabilities, Gen AI agents can understand prompts, reason through scenarios, and make informed decisions without prolonged training. Leveraging agentic AI could enable the rapid prototyping and deployment of intelligent agents that handle complex financial tasks with minimal setup costs. Moreover, integrating these AI agents into a full-fledged multi-agent payment system simulator could help model systemic gridlock dynamics, study network effects, and evaluate system resilience under stress scenarios. Such a sandbox would offer a safe and controlled testbed for researchers and policymakers for policy evaluation, regulatory experimentation, and the assessment of alternative system designs.
