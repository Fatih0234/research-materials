## 2.3 Beyond as a Game Player

While much of the discussion has been centered on utilizing game-based scenarios to evaluate LLMs, work has also shown that LLM capability in games can, in turn, contribute to game theory. This section explores alternative roles for LLMs within game-theoretic contexts, broadening their applications.

In section 2.1, we noted that LLMs often struggle to compute optimal strategies in classical matrix games. However, some studies take an alternative approach by leveraging LLMs' natural language understanding instead of their ability to compute equilibria directly. For example, [Mensfelt et al. , 2024] utilizes LLMs to formalize game descriptions into a Game Description Language (GDL), allowing external solvers to process them. Similarly, [Deng et al. , 2025] introduces a twostage framework for translating extensive-form games: first, the LLM identifies the information set, and then it constructs the complete game tree using in-context learning. These studies suggest that LLMs can act as intermediaries in converting natural language into formal game structures, a capability beyond traditional models.

Additionally, [Horton, 2023] explores the use of LLMs as substitutes for human participants in behavioral economic experiments. Their findings indicate that LLMs can replicate classic behavioral economics results, providing a scalable and cost-effective alternative for conducting social science research. This underscores the potential of LLMs as valuable tools in experimental economics and social science studies, facilitating large-scale simulations and deeper insights into human decision-making.
