## 4 Game Theory for LLM-Related Modeling

This section provides an overview of research on gametheoretic models that involve LLMs. The theoretical analysis of these models provides evidence of LLMs' impact on human

society. We categorize the literature into three main areas. The first area explores game-theoretic models that include both LLMs and humans, aiming to explain or predict the phenomena resulting from the development of LLMs. The second area examines scenarios where LLMs function as products or platforms. This creates competitive environments that exhibit game-theoretic dynamics like ad auctions. The third area extends classical game theory models, investigating how LLMs' unique capabilities can generalize and refine these models for more complex and realistic settings.
