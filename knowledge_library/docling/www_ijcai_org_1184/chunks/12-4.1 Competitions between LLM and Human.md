## 4.1 Competitions between LLM and Human

This body of work introduces several competition models, treating LLMs as players in the game [Yao et al. , 2024; Esmaeili et al. , 2024; Taitler and Ben-Porat, 2024]. These models generally arise from a recognition: modern LLMs possess powerful content generation capabilities and, compared to human creators, are characterized by lower costs and faster evolutionary rates.

[Yao et al. , 2024] investigates the impact of LLMs on human creators by proposing a competition model based on the Tullock contest. This model explores the dynamics between human-generated and LLM-generated content, modeling LLMs as cost-free players whose output quality improves as human content quality increases. Through equilibrium analysis, the study concludes that LLMs do not fundamentally conflict with or replace human creators but instead reduce the volume of human-generated content, ultimately pushing out less efficient creators. [Esmaeili et al. , 2024] extends this model into a repeated game setting, focusing on how humans can optimize their utility in dynamic competition with AI across various content domains. The study highlights the computational complexity of determining optimal strategies and proposes practical algorithms that offer near-optimal solutions.

[Taitler and Ben-Porat, 2024] examines the competitive dynamics between LLM-based generative AI and humanoperated platforms, such as Stack Overflow, and their implications for social welfare. The study models the revenuemaximization problem of LLMs and uncovers phenomena akin to Braess's paradox: as human users increasingly rely on LLMs, the original platforms suffer from a lack of qualityenhancing data. Furthermore, generative AI models rarely undergo training aimed at quality improvement due to costsaving incentives. The study also suggests theoretical regulatory frameworks to address these issues.

The development of LLMs has led to diverse societal effects, and game theory provides a robust theoretical framework for studying these effects. By employing appropriate models depicting optimal behaviors and equilibrium strategies, we can derive properties with theoretical guarantees.
