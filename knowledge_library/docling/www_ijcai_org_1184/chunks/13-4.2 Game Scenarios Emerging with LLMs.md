## 4.2 Game Scenarios Emerging with LLMs

This section explores game-theoretic scenarios that arise from LLMs as products or platforms. In these scenarios, LLMs do not participate in the games; instead, they revolve around them.

As LLMs gain global attention, industries related to LLMs are creating substantial commercial value. [Laufer et al. , 2024] explores the feasibility of fine-tuning general-purpose models as a market service. The study models the bargaining process between generalists developing the model and domain specialists adapting it. By analyzing the sub-game perfect equilibria, the paper demonstrates that a profit-sharing outcome is possible and offers methods for determining Pareto-optimal equilibria. [Sun et al. , 2024a] investigates potential economic scenarios in which a platform offers fine-tuning services for LLMs through an auction-like process for multiple groups with different preferences. The study proposes an incentivecompatible payment scheme that guarantees social welfare maximization. [Mahmood, 2024] analyzes the competitive dynamics of LLM deployment, highlighting the value of market information and demonstrating that a first-to-market strategy may be cost-ineffective for all tasks when those tasks are sufficiently similar. [Saig et al. , 2024] proposes a pay-forpreference payment with a contract design model to address the potential moral hazard in the current pay-per-token pricing scheme.

In addition to their role as commodities, LLMs also offer potential commercial value through advertising revenue, similar to search engines. The emergence of LLMs has made traditional fixed-slot advertisements obsolete, prompting several studies on integrating LLMs into advertising auctions [Feizi et al. , 2023]. [Duetting et al. , 2024] models a scenario where each advertiser owns an agent LLM and bids to influence the probability distribution of the next token generated. The study derives an auction mechanism that ensures incentive compatibility by modifying the second-price auction. [Dubey et al. , 2024] assumes each advertiser provides a fixed advertisement copy, influencing LLM summaries through bidding. Their auction mechanism determines the prominence of each advertiser in the summary and the price they pay, ensuring incentive compatibility. [Hajiaghayi et al. , 2024] also assumes each advertiser possesses a document representing their content but models the advertisement insertion process in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. The mechanism probabilistically retrieves and allocates ads within each discourse segment of LLM-generated content, optimizing for logarithmic social welfare based on bids and relevance. [Soumalias et al. , 2024] investigates a scenario where each advertiser bids via a reward function for LLM-generated content. Their mechanism incentivizes truthful reporting of reward functions and demonstrates operational viability in a tuningfree setting.
