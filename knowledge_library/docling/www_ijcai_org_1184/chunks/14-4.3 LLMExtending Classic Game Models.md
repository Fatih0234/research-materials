## 4.3 LLMExtending Classic Game Models

In addition to these two areas, this section examines works that enhance traditional game theory models using LLMs, extending their applicability to more realistic scenarios.

LLMs' text comprehension and generation capabilities make them valuable tools for aggregating and eliciting opinions. [Lu et al. , 2024] explores using LLMs to assist peer review, noting that traditional peer prediction mechanisms are limited to simple reports, such as multiple-choice or scalar numbers. The study proposes peer prediction mechanisms that leverage LLMs' powerful text-processing capabilities to incentivize high-quality, truthful feedback. These mechanisms are shown to distinguish between human-written and LLM-generated reviews in empirical experiments. [Fish et

al. , 2024a] uses LLMs to address the limitations of traditional social choice theory, which is constrained to choices among a few predetermined alternatives. The study employs LLMs to generate text and extrapolate preferences, providing a method for designing AI-augmented democratic processes with rigorous representation guarantees. [Sun et al. , 2024b] investigates how LLMs can provide richer information in traditional auctions. The study introduces the Semantic-enhanced Personalized Valuation in the Auction framework, which leverages LLMs to incorporate bidders' preferences and semantic item information into the valuation process. The framework integrates fine-tuned LLMs with the Vickrey auction mechanism to improve valuation accuracy and bidding strategies.
