## Statistics

n/a Confirmed

For all statistical analyses, confirm that the following items are present in the figure legend, table legend, main text, or Methods section.

- [ ] X The exact sample size (n) for each experimental group/condition, given as a discrete number and unit of measurement

- [ ] A statement on whether measurements were taken from distinct samples or whether the same sample was measured repeatedly

- [ ] The statistical test(s) used AND whether they are one- or two-sided

- [ ] Only common tests should be described solely by name; describe more complex techniques in the Methods section.

- [ ] A description of all covariates tested

- [ ] A description of any assumptions or corrections, such as tests of normality and adjustment for multiple comparisons

- [ ] A full description of the statistical parameters including central tendency (e.g. means) or other basic estimates (e.g. regression coefficient) AND variation (e.g. standard deviation) or associated estimates of uncertainty (e.g. confidence intervals)

- [ ] For null hypothesis testing, the test statistic (e.g. F, t, r) with confidence intervals, effect sizes, degrees of freedom and P value noted Give P values as exact values whenever suitable.

- [ ] For Bayesian analysis, information on the choice of priors and Markov chain Monte Carlo settings

- [x] For hierarchical and complex designs, identification of the appropriate level for tests and full reporting of outcomes

- [ ] Estimates of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d, Pearson's r), indicating how they were calculated

Our web collection on statistics for biologists contains articles on many of the points above.
