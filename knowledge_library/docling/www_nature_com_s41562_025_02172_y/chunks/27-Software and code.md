## Software and code

Policy information about availability of computer code

For our model tasks, we used the public OpenAl API with the GPT-4, text-davinci-003 and text-davinci-002 models which are available via the completion endpoint, Meta Al's Llama 2 70B Chat model, and the Anthropic API model Claude 2 to run our simulations. Human data was collected via Prolific using an online experiment written in JavaScript/HTML/CSS.

Data analysis

Behavioural data was analysed using R (4.4.0) and Python (3.11). The model simulations were implemented in Python. The code underlying this study, prompt variations and model simulations are available on github.com/eliaka/repeatedgames.

For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors and reviewers. We strongly encourage code deposition in a community repository (e.g. GitHub). See the Nature Portfolio guidelines for submitting code &amp; software for further information.
