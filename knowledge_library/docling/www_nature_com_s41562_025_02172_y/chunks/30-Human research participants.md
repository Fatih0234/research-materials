Ethics oversight

Sex and gender were not relevant in study design. The study was distributed evenly to male and female participants. Sex and gender was determined based on participant demographics on the Prolific platform.

N=195, 89 females, mean age=26.72, SD=4.19.

Participants were recruited from Prolific and were required to be fluent speakers of English. The study may exhibit selfselection bias since participants voluntarily joined via Prolific and were limited to fluent English speakers, potentially reducing generalisability to non-English speaking populations. However, the behavioral games used are based on universal decisionmaking principles. The use of English speakers was due to language proficiency, not a theoretical limitation.
