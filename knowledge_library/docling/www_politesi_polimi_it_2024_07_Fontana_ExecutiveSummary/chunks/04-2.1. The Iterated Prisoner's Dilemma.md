## 2.1. The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma

The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is a classic thought experiment in Game Theory (the branch of mathematics that studies the interaction between rational agents and their modeling) and serves as a paradigm for analyzing conflict and cooperation between two players. In this scenario, two players who cannot communicate with each other can choose between two actions ( Cooperate and Defect ), and depending on the combination of chosen actions they receive a payoff. Mutual cooperation results in the highest collective payoff, with a reward R for both. If one player defects while the other cooperates, the defector receives a higher temptation payoff of T while the cooperator receives the lower sucker's payoff of S . If both defect, they each receive a punishment payoff of P for failing to cooperate. This game's structure is traditionally defined by the hierarchy T &gt; R &gt; P &gt; S , which typically encourages rational players to prefer defection as it is their dominant strategy. In its iterated version (IPD), if the number of rounds is finite and known to both players, the game has one theoretical solution which is to always choose Defect , if it is infinite or unknown no strategy universally outperforms all others. Interestingly, human subjects tend to play more cooperatively than the optimal solution regardless of the number of rounds and their knowledge about it.
