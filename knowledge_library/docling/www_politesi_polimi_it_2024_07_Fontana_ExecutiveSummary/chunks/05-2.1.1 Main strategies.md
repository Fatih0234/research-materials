## 2.1.1 Main strategies

The main strategies that best describe human approaches are: Always Cooperate , Always Defect , Tit For Tat (where the player starts with Cooperate and then mimics the opponent's previous action), Suspicious Tit For Tat (like TFT , but starts with Defect ), Grim Trigger (where the player starts with Cooperate and chooses Defect for the rest of the game, once the opponent has defected), and Win -Stay Lose -Shift (where the player starts with Cooperate and then repeats the previous action if the payoff was R or T . otherwise the other action is chosen). More than 75% of the time, humans play a combination of AD , GRIM , and TFT [5].
