## 3.3. Behaviors

The second problem pertains to understanding the embedded behaviors of state-of-the-art LLMs to align them with human values. While GT and the IPD can serve this scope, there is no commonly used behavioral framework to characterize the choice patterns displayed by LLMs, and more structural effort is needed. Therefore my work represents an initial step in this direction. Given a game history, I profiled the LLMs' behavior in two ways. First, for each dimension d (§ 2.1), I computed the score against each α and its average distance from the RND score. Second, I used the SFEM to find which strategies best explained the player's sequence of actions. For this, I used the following set of candidate strategies and averaged the scores over all the histories analyzed: AC , AD , RND , TFT , STFT , GRIM , and WSLS .
