## 4.1. SFEM analysis

Fig. 4 illustrates which strategies best explain the behaviors of GPT3.5 and Llama3 as the values of α increase. Llama3 consistently aligns with GRIM , displaying an exploitative approach even when the opponent tends to cooperate for the majority of the time. GPT3.5 shifts from GRIM to AC once the opponent's probability of cooperation exceeds 0 . 6 . Interestingly, GPT3.5's approach for cooperative scenarios can be explained by AC even if it never reaches a full cooperation pattern, being another sign of non-strategic behavior. If compared with humans (who play AD in non-cooperative contexts and a mixture of TFT and GRIM in cooperative ones), GPT3.5 is consistently more cooperative than them. Differently, Llama3 is still more cooperative in hostile environments but less when cooperation is encouraged.
