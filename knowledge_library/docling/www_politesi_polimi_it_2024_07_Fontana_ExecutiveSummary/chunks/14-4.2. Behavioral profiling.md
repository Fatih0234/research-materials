## 4.2. Behavioral profiling

Fig. 5 presents the scores for all the other dimensions outlined in § 2.1, and computed for both Llama3 and GPT3.5 as α varies. Llama3

is extremely Nice but not particularly Retaliatory and even less Forgiving . It tends to score high in Troublemaking , suggesting it often initiates unprovoked defections. Finally, it displays lower levels of emulation as α grows (except when facing AC ). GPT3.5 is more Forgiving , less Retaliatory , and less Troublemaking than Llama3. These findings align with the higher cooperation observed in Fig. 3. Fig. 6 shows that GPT3.5 exhibits behaviors closer to the random baseline than Llama3.
