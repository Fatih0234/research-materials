## 6. Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my supervisors Francesco and Luca, the NERDS group, my friends (old and new), and my family for all the support, love, and precious advice that I received. A special thanks goes to Ivano for all his assistance and patience.

I would like to acknowledge the support from the Danish Data Science Academy through the DDSA Visit Grant (Grant ID: 2023-1856) and from Politecnico di Milano through the scholarship 'Tesi all'estero a.a. 2023/24-Primo bando'. I would like to acknowledge the aid of ChatGPT in revising the writing work.
