## [The T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction#the-t3-stack)
The _“T3 Stack”_ is a web development stack made by [Theo↗](https://twitter.com/t3dotgg) focused on simplicity, modularity, and full-stack typesafety.
The core pieces are [**Next.js** ↗](https://nextjs.org/) and [**TypeScript** ↗](https://typescriptlang.org/). [**Tailwind CSS** ↗](https://tailwindcss.com/) is almost always included. If you’re doing anything resembling backend, [**tRPC** ↗](https://trpc.io/), [**Prisma** ↗](https://prisma.io/), and [**NextAuth.js** ↗](https://next-auth.js.org/) are great additions too.
You may have noticed that there are a… lot of pieces. That’s by design. Swap pieces in and out as you need - this stack is modular at its core :)
