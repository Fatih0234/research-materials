### [Solve Problems](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction#solve-problems)
It’s easy to fall into the trap of “adding everything” - we explicitly don’t want to do that. Everything added to 
`create-t3-app`
should solve a specific problem that exists within the core technologies included. This means we won’t add things like state libraries (
`zustand`
, 
`redux`
) but we will add things like NextAuth.js and integrate Prisma and tRPC for you.
