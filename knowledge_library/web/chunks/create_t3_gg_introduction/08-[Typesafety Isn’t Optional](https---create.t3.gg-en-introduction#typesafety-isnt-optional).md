### [Typesafety Isn’t Optional](https://create.t3.gg/en/introduction#typesafety-isnt-optional)
The stated goal of Create T3 App is to provide the quickest way to start a new full-stack, **typesafe** web application. We take typesafety seriously in these parts as it improves our productivity and helps us ship fewer bugs. Any decision that compromises the typesafe nature of Create T3 App is a decision that should be made in a different project.
