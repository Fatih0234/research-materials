Diamond") of the [University of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Chicago "University of Chicago") and [Philip H. Dybvig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_H._Dybvig "Philip H. Dybvig"), then of [Yale University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yale_University "Yale University").[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond%E2%80%93Dybvig_model#cite_note-3) It shows how an institution with long-maturity assets and short-maturity liabilities can be unstable.
