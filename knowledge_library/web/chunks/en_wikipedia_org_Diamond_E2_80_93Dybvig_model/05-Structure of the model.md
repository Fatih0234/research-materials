### Structure of the model
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diamond%E2%80%93Dybvig_model&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Structure of the model")]
Diamond and Dybvig's paper points out that business investment often requires expenditures in the present to obtain returns in the future. Therefore, they prefer loans with a long [maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_\(finance\) "Maturity \(finance\)") (that is, low [liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity "Liquidity")). The same principle applies to individuals seeking financing to purchase large-ticket items such as [housing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House "House") or [automobiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automobile "Automobile"). On the other hand, individual savers (both households and firms) may have sudden, unpredictable needs for cash, due to unforeseen expenditures. So they demand [liquid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquidity "Liquidity") accounts which permit them immediate access to their deposits (that is, they value short [maturity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_\(finance\) "Maturity \(finance\)") deposit accounts). 
The banks in the model act as intermediaries between savers who prefer to deposit in liquid accounts and borrowers who prefer to take out long-maturity loans. Under ordinary circumstances, banks can provide a valuable service by channeling funds from many individual deposits into loans for borrowers. Individual depositors might not be able to make these loans themselves, since they know they may suddenly need immediate access to their funds, whereas the businesses' investments will only pay off in the future (moreover, by aggregating funds from many different depositors, banks help depositors save on the [transaction costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_cost "Transaction cost") they would have to pay in order to lend directly to businesses). Since banks provide a valuable service to both sides (providing the long-maturity loans businesses want and the liquid accounts depositors want), they can charge a higher interest rate on loans than they pay on deposits and thus profit from the difference.
