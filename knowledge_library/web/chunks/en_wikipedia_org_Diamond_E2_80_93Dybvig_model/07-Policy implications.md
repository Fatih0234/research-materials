## Policy implications
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diamond%E2%80%93Dybvig_model&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Policy implications")]
In practice, due to [fractional reserve banking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_reserve_banking "Fractional reserve banking"), banks faced with a bank run usually shut down and refuse to permit more withdrawals. However, Diamond and Dybvig argue that unless the total amount of real expenditure needs per period is known with certainty, suspension of convertibility cannot be the optimal mechanism for preventing bank runs. Instead, they argue that a better way of preventing bank runs is [deposit insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_insurance "Deposit insurance") backed by the government or [central bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_bank "Central bank"). Such insurance pays depositors all or part of their losses in the case of a bank run. If depositors know that they will get their money back even in case of a bank run, they have no reason to participate in a bank run. 
Thus, sufficient [deposit insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposit_insurance "Deposit insurance") can eliminate the possibility of bank runs. In principle, maintaining a deposit insurance program is unlikely to be very costly for the government: as long as bank runs are prevented, deposit insurance will never actually need to be paid out. However an IMF working paper has questioned the effectiveness of deposit insurance in a crisis.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond%E2%80%93Dybvig_model#cite_note-5)
