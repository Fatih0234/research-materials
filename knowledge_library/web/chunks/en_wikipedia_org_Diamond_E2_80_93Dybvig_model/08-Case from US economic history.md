### Case from US economic history
[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Diamond%E2%80%93Dybvig_model&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Case from US economic history")]
Bank runs became much rarer in the U.S. after the [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Deposit_Insurance_Corporation "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation") was founded in the aftermath of the bank panics of the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression"). On the other hand, a deposit insurance scheme is likely to lead to [moral hazard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard "Moral hazard"): by protecting depositors against bank failure, it makes depositors less careful in choosing where to deposit their money, and thus gives banks less incentive to lend carefully.
