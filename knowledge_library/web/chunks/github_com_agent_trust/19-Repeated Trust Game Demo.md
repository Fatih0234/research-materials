#### Repeated Trust Game Demo
[](https://github.com/camel-ai/agent-trust#repeated-trust-game-demo)
For the repeated trust game demo, execute this command:
```
python agent_trust/repeated_demo.py
```

Running this command will start the demo where the trust game is played repeatedly, illustrating how trust can evolve over repeated interactions.
Ensure you have the required environment set up and dependencies installed before running these commands. Enjoy exploring the trust dynamics in both scenarios!
