### Web Interface for Experiments
[](https://github.com/camel-ai/agent-trust#web-interface-for-experiments)
To access a web interface for running the experiments (demo), execute `agent_trust/no_repeated_demo.py` or `agent_trust/repeated_demo.py`. This provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the experiment setup. You can also visit our online demo websites: [Trust Game Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/camel-ai/agent-trust-Trust-Game-Demo) & [Repeated Trust Game Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/camel-ai/agent-trust-Repeated-trust-game-Demo)
