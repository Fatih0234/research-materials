## Google research shows ads of the future won’t be placed. They’ll be written live by LLMs, shaped token by token through advertiser bids.
The world of [PPC](https://searchengineland.com/guide/what-is-paid-search) advertising is heading toward one of its most profound shifts. 
Until now, advertisers competed for slots on search results pages, placing ads that a platform simply displayed. 
But a new generation of large language models (LLMs) introduces a radical alternative: ads that aren’t chosen, but **written in real time** , based on an auction for the very words being generated.
That idea, which sounds like science fiction, is now backed by real research. 
Google Research and the University of Chicago [published a paper](https://research.google/blog/mechanism-design-for-large-language-models/) outlining a theoretical and practical framework for how ad auctions could work in the age of generative AI.
The concept of embedding ads into AI-generated outputs isn’t new. 
Back in 2018, Google filed a patent titled “[Using various AI entities as advertising mediums](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20180150749A1/en),” exploring how virtual assistants and chatbots could integrate sponsored messaging into conversations. 
But with today’s advanced LLMs, that early vision becomes far more dynamic: not just inserting ads into conversations, but letting the ad _become_ the conversation.
