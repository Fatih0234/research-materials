## Redefining brand preferences
In this framework, advertisers no longer submit static ad copy or landing pages. Instead, they “teach” an LLM to speak in their brand’s voice. 
This model acts as a dynamic representation of what the brand would say in any given context.
It’s no longer about crafting a single great headline; it’s about engineering a probabilistic system that reliably outputs brand-aligned language in real-time conversations.
