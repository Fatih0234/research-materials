## Preserving privacy, reducing friction
Another key aspect of the proposed system is technical decoupling. 
The main generative model (e.g., the one responding to the user) does not directly access the internal logic of each advertiser’s LLM. 
Instead, each advertiser privately computes the probabilities of next tokens and submits them to the auction system.
This means brands can participate without revealing proprietary models or logic, while the central engine remains efficient and modular.
