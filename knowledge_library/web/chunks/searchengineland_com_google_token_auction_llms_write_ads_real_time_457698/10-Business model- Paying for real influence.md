## Business model: Paying for real influence
In a classic [Vickrey auction](https://web.stanford.edu/~jdlevin/Econ%20286/Auctions.pdf), you only pay if your bid changes the outcome. 
The same applies here: an advertiser pays only when their influence causes the system to generate a token they prefer over what would have otherwise been selected.
The measure of this influence? 
A statistical metric called total variation distance (TVD), which quantifies how much the final output deviates from the default due to a given advertiser’s input.
It’s a shift from clicks and impressions to token-level ROI. 
For the first time, brand impact can be measured at the granularity of individual words.
