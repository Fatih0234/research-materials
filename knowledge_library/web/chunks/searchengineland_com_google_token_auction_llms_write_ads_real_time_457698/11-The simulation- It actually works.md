## The simulation: It actually works
The researchers tested the model using Gemma 7B, an open-source LLM, with two dummy advertisers: one formal, one casual. 
Each advertiser submitted different stylistic preferences through their model, and the results showed a clear correlation between higher bids and stronger influence over tone and wording.
Sample prompt: “What’s a good weekend activity?”
By adjusting the bid ratio between the two advertisers, the generated text shifted predictably toward one tone or the other. 
Graphs and tables in the paper illustrate how this influence can be modeled, tracked, and monetized.

This model doesn’t just apply to ads, it mirrors a broader shift from retrieval-based systems (like SEO) to generation-based visibility (aka GEO – [generative engine optimization](https://searchengineland.com/what-is-generative-engine-optimization-geo-444418)).
In SEO, you optimize a page to appear when searched. In GEO, you optimize your language to appear as part of the generated answer.
What token auction suggests is that paid GEO may soon follow, where the response itself is shaped in real time by the brands that pay to participate.
