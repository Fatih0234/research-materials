## A glimpse at the ad system of the future
Hard to predict exactly what this will look like? Here’s one possible workflow:
  * A brand fine-tunes its own LLM to reflect its messaging style.
  * The campaign manager sets objectives (e.g., “be mentioned when someone asks about romantic getaways”) and places a bid.
  * When a user query triggers a generative response, the auction evaluates token-by-token, which advertisers have relevant models and active bids.
  * The final answer is written collaboratively by the system, shaped by the brands that influence its language.
  * In the advertiser dashboard, there are no clicks. Instead: token-level heatmaps, influence scores, and true cost per generated impression.
