## What it means for marketers
This isn’t about choosing which of your five ad versions performs best. It’s about influencing what the AI actually says.
  * **No more static creatives:** The system generates messaging live.
  * **Language engineering beats copywriting:** Success depends on probabilistic language modeling, not catchy taglines.
  * **Multi-brand responses become standard:** Multiple advertisers can appear in the same answer.
  * **Presence over placement:** Brands aim to _shape_ the message, not just appear beside it.
  * **A new model of ROI:** Impact isn’t clicks or views, it’s influence over output.
