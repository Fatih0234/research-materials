## Already starting: Google’s AI ads today
This isn’t just theoretical. 
In May 2025, Google began testing search and shopping ads inside [AI Overviews](https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-overviews-everything-you-need-to-know-449399) and [AI Mode](https://searchengineland.com/google-ai-mode-actionable-tips-456897). These sponsored messages now appear within generative results on both mobile and desktop.
More ads are now embedded inside AI answers than ever before, according to[ The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/news/671514/google-ai-mode-overviews-ads-expansion). 
They’re still traditional in format (labeled, clickable, and visually distinct), but the direction is clear: ads are moving **into** the content.
