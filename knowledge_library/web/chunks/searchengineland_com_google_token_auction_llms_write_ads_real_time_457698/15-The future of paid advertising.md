## The future of paid advertising
It’s not just Google. Meta has [announced](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/meta-aims-to-fully-automate-ad-creation-using-ai-7d82e249) that by the end of 2026, it aims to roll out fully automated paid ad campaigns, where businesses won’t even write ads. 
The advertiser simply provides a goal (“e.g., sell green running shoes”), and the system handles creative, targeting, testing, and optimization.
Taken together, the shifts we’re seeing from both Google and Meta reveal a future where paid media is no longer just about targeting or placement. 
It’s about collaboration with machines that generate, optimize, and deliver brand messaging on the fly.
We’re moving from:
  * Pre-written ads to AI-generated responses.
  * Manual optimization to real-time probabilistic influence.
  * Click-through rates to token-level brand presence.


Whether through Google’s token-level auctions or Meta’s fully automated campaign flow, the common thread is clear: paid advertising is becoming generative.
For marketers, the path forward will require new skills, new strategies, and a deep understanding of how to shape AI outputs without ever writing a traditional ad.
