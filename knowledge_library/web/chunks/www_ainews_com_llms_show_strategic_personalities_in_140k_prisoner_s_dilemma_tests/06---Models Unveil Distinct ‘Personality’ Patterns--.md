## **Models Unveil Distinct ‘Personality’ Patterns**
Despite being trained on similar sets of internet text and written materials, each model showed unique behavioral signatures:
  * **Gemini (Google):** Adapted dynamically and ruthlessly to opponents’ moves, switching rapidly between cooperation and defection to maximize outcomes.  

  * **OpenAI (ChatGPT):** Leaned toward cooperation, even when repeatedly exploited—suggesting a built-in bias toward trust or risk mitigation at the expense of short-term gains.  

  * **Anthropic’s Claude:** Showed the highest “forgiveness rate,” willing to return to cooperation after betrayals—indicating a more forgiving, resilient strategy.


The research team mapped these behavioral “fingerprints” to visualize how each model reacted after wins or betrayals, highlighting strategic divergence across systems.
