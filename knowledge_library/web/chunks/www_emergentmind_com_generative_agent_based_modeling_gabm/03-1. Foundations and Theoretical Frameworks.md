## 1. Foundations and Theoretical Frameworks
At the core of GABM is the integration of probabilistic and deep generative modeling techniques with multi-agent simulation. In traditional population synthesis—a key input for large-scale modeling of transport and social systems—[deep generative models](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/deep-generative-models) such as [Variational Autoencoders](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/variational-autoencoders) ([VAEs](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/variational-autoencoders-vaes)) are used to learn the full joint distribution of agent attributes, thereby overcoming limitations of classic methods like Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF), Gibbs sampling, and Bayesian networks in high-dimensional settings ([Borysov et al., 2018](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/1808.06910)). VAEs compress high-dimensional attribute vectors X=(X1,…,Xn)X=(X_1,\ldots,X_n)X=(X1​,…,Xn​) into a compact latent space ZZZ, yielding scalable and flexible generation of realistic agents by sampling from the learned latent distribution.
GABM extends this approach by embedding generative models within autonomous agents who interact within mechanistic simulation environments. Each agent's behavior—be it in physical, social, or digital domains—is dynamically generated by prompting a LLM or deep network with contextual information, personality, memory, and environmental feedback ([Vezhnevets et al., 2023](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2312.03664), [Ghaffarzadegan et al., 2023](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2309.11456)).
A canonical GABM agent comprises:
  * **Profile/State:** Personalized agent attributes (e.g., demographics, interests, skills).
  * **Memory:** Structured as both short-term and long-term stores, with mechanisms for semantic recall and temporal encoding ([Xiao et al., 2023](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2311.06957), [Vezhnevets et al., 2023](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2312.03664)).
  * **Reasoning Module:** Executes context-sensitive decision-making, often via [chain-of-thought prompting](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/chain-of-thought-prompting-cotp) and multi-step evaluation ([Ghaffarzadegan et al., 2023](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2309.11456), [Xu et al., 5 Jun 2025](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2506.04699)).
  * **Interaction Interface:** Enables natural language exchanges with other agents, digital environments, or game-master coordinators ([Vezhnevets et al., 2023](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2312.03664), [Ferraro et al., 2024](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2411.16031)).
