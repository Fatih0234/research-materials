## 3. Practical Applications Across Domains
GABM frameworks have been demonstrated in a wide variety of research domains:
  * **Population Synthesis:** VAEs enable fitting the full joint distribution of hundreds of socio-demographic or behavioral variables, allowing generation of synthetic agents for urban, transport, and epidemiological simulation at unprecedented scale and resolution ([Borysov et al., 2018](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/1808.06910)).
  * **Epidemiological Modeling:** LLM-enhanced agents in epidemic simulations reason about personal health, risk, and social context, producing behaviors such as self-isolation, quarantine, and adaptation to public health messaging. This approach yields emergent epidemic curves, multiple waves, and feedback-sensitive social dynamics ([Williams et al., 2023](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2307.04986), [Choi et al., 10 Jun 2025](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2506.13783)).
  * **Social Phenomena:** By integrating social psychology with generative reasoning, GABMs capture complex effects such as social norm diffusion, echo chamber formation, polarization in online networks, and the friendship paradox in large-scale social simulations ([Ghaffarzadegan et al., 2023](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2309.11456), [Ferraro et al., 2024](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2411.16031), [Orlando et al., 9 Feb 2025](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2502.05919)).
  * **Digital Economy and MMO Simulations:** [LLM-based agents](https://www.emergentmind.com/topics/llm-based-agents) model market behaviors including bargaining, specialization, coalition formation, and price-setting with realism that rule-based or RL agents cannot achieve. These systems support studies of policy, taxation, and emergent economic phenomena in synthetic societies ([Dizaji, 2024](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2411.17724), [Xu et al., 5 Jun 2025](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2506.04699)).
  * **Public Administration and Crisis Simulation:** GABM is used for modeling government response to crises, such as water pollution events, allowing integration of agent memory, reflection, and public event dynamics entirely in natural language environments ([Xiao et al., 2023](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2311.06957)).
  * **Human-Assistant Interaction Design:** Generative agents simulate human subjects in studies of assistant systems, enabling scalable, privacy-preserving, and reproducible evaluations of design scenarios previously restricted to costly human-in-the-loop experiments ([Xuan et al., 15 May 2025](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2505.09938)).
