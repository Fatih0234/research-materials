## 4. Model Validation, Calibration, and Limitations
A central challenge in GABM is the validation and calibration of generatively empowered agents. While subjective believability, human expert review, and text similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity of embeddings) are commonly used, these do not establish operational validity across the intended domain ([Larooij et al., 4 Apr 2025](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2504.03274)).
Limitations identified in the literature include:
  * **Computational Cost:** GABMs amplify traditional ABM complexity, as the cost of simulating nnn LLM-driven agents grows with C(n)∝n2×LLMcostC(n) \propto n^2 \times \text{LLM}_{\text{cost}}C(n)∝n2×LLMcost​ ([Larooij et al., 4 Apr 2025](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2504.03274)).
  * **Interpretability:** The black-box nature of LLMs obscures causal mechanisms underlying emergent phenomena, complicating causal inference and theory-building.
  * **Reproducibility and Stochasticity:** Variability inherent in LLM outputs challenges consistent experimental replication.
  * **Bias and Hallucination:** Generative agents risk unintended propagation of social or factual biases, and hallucinated reasoning or actions.


Efforts are ongoing to develop better calibration protocols, standardized benchmarks, and hybrid modeling that combines simplicity and theoretical clarity with generative depth ([Larooij et al., 4 Apr 2025](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2504.03274), [Navarro et al., 2024](https://www.emergentmind.com/papers/2411.07038)).
