## 7. Summary
GABM represents a significant methodological advance in computational modeling, coupling the expressive, adaptable reasoning of generative models with agent-based simulation frameworks. This enables nuanced, context-sensitive modeling of complex systems across physical, social, and digital domains, with emerging use in social science, epidemiology, economics, and human–computer interaction. Critical scientific challenges remain in operational validation, interpretability, and resource scaling, but the ongoing development of specialized libraries, validation protocols, and interdisciplinary methods is expanding the scope and rigor of GABM research.
